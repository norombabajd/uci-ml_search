","Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements.  The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task.  Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age.  Further information, such as weather patterns and location (hence food availability) may be required to solve the problem.

From the original data examples with missing values were removed (the majority having the predicted value missing), and the ranges of the continuous values have been scaled for use with an ANN (by dividing by 200).",,"Sam Waugh (1995) ""Extending and benchmarking Cascade-Correlation"", PhD thesis, Computer Science Department, University of Tasmania.

The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price.   Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale.  Actuarians call this process ""symboling"".  A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.

The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year.  This value is normalized for all autos within a particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons, sports/speciality, etc...), and represents the average loss per car per year.

The first 30 features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.  They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. A few of the images can be found at http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~street/images/

The separation described above was obtained using Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, ""Decision Tree Construction Via Linear Programming."" Proceedings of the 4th Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society, pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear programming to construct a decision tree.  Relevant features were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4 features and 1-3 separating planes.

The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane in the 3-dimensional space is that described in: 
[K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: ""Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets"", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

The Recurrence Surface Approximation (RSA) method is a linear programming model which predicts Time To Recur using both recurrent and nonrecurrent cases.  See references (i) and (ii) above for details of the RSA method.

The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates CAR to the six input attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety.

Because of known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.

(fax) +61 2 663 4576","An Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) or relational learning framework is assumed (Muggleton, 1992). The learning system is provided with examples of chess positions described only by the coordinates of the pieces on the board. Background knowledge in the form of row and column differences is also supplied. The relations necessary to form a correct and concise classifier for the target concept must be discovered by the learning system (the examples already provide a complete extensional definition). The task is closely related to Quinlan's (1983) application of ID3 to classify White King and Rook against Black King and Knight (KRKN) positions as lost 2-ply or lost 3-ply. The framework is similar in that the example positions supply only low-grade data. An important difference is that additional background predicates of the kind supplied in the KRKN study via hand-crafted attributes are not provided for this KRK domain.

Chess endgames are complex domains which are enumerable. Endgame databases are tables of stored game-theoretic values for the enumerated elements (legal positions) of the domain. The game-theoretic values stored denote whether or not positions are won for either side, or include also the depth of win (number of moves) assuming minimax-optimal play. From the point of view of experiments on computer induction such databases provide not only a source of examples but also an oracle (Roycroft, 1986) for testing induced rules. However a chess endgame database differs from, say, a relational database containing details of parts and suppliers in the following important respect. The combinatorics of computing the required game-theoretic values for individual position entries independently would be prohibitive. Therefore all the database entries are generated in a single iterative process using the ``standard backup'' algorithm (Thompson, 1986).

A KRK database was described by Clarke (1977). The current database was described and used for machine learning experiments in Bain (1992; 1994). It should be noted that our database is not guaranteed correct, but the class distribution is the same as Clarke's database. In (Bain 1992; 1994) the task was classification of positions in the database as won for white in a fixed number of moves, assuming optimal play by both sides. The problem was structured into separate sub-problems by depth-of-win ordered draw, zero, one, ..., sixteen. When learning depth d all examples at depths > d are used as negatives. Quinlan (1994) applied Foil to learn a complete and correct solution for this task.

The typical complexity of induced classifiers in this domain suggest that the task is demanding when background knowledge is restricted.",,"M. Bain. ""Learning optimal chess strategies"", ILP 92:  ICOT TM-1182, S. Muggleton, Institute for New Generation Computer Technology, Tokyo, Japan.

The actual forest cover type for a given observation (30 x 30 meter cell) was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System (RIS) data.  Independent variables were derived from data originally obtained from US Geological Survey (USGS) and USFS data.  Data is in raw form (not scaled) and contains binary (0 or 1) columns of data for qualitative independent variables (wilderness areas and soil types).

This study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado.  These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices.

Some background information for these four wilderness areas: Neota (area 2) probably has the highest mean elevational value of the 4 wilderness areas. Rawah (area 1) and Comanche Peak (area 3) would have a lower mean elevational value, while Cache la Poudre (area 4) would have the lowest mean elevational value. 

As for primary major tree species in these areas, Neota would have spruce/fir (type 1), while Rawah and Comanche Peak would probably have lodgepole pine (type 2) as their primary species, followed by spruce/fir and aspen (type 5). Cache la Poudre would tend to have Ponderosa pine (type 3), Douglas-fir (type 6), and cottonwood/willow (type 4).  

The Rawah and Comanche Peak areas would tend to be more typical of the overall dataset than either the Neota or Cache la Poudre, due to their assortment of tree species and range of predictive variable values (elevation, etc.)  Cache la Poudre would probably  be more unique than the others, due to its relatively low  elevation range and species composition.

ABSTRACT: Machine learning tools show significant promise for knowledge acquisition, particularly when human expertise is inadequate. Recently, process delays known as cylinder banding in rotogravure printing were substantially mitigated using control rules discovered by decision tree induction. Our work exemplifies a more general methodology which transforms the knowledge acquisition task from one in which rules are directly elicited from an expert, to one in which a learning system is responsible for rule generation. The primary responsibilities of the human expert are to evaluate the merits of generated rules, and to guide the acquisition and classification of data necessary for machine induction. These responsibilities require the expert to do what an expert does best: to exercise his or her expertise. This seems a more natural fit to an expert's capabilities than the requirements of traditional methodologies that experts explicitly enumerate the rules that they employ.",,"Evans, B., and Fisher, D.

The differential diagnosis of erythemato-squamous diseases is a real problem in dermatology. They all share the clinical features of erythema and scaling, with very little differences. The diseases in this group are psoriasis, seboreic dermatitis, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, cronic dermatitis, and pityriasis rubra pilaris. Usually a biopsy is necessary for the diagnosis but unfortunately these diseases share many histopathological features as well. Another difficulty for the differential diagnosis is that a disease may show the features of another disease at the beginning stage and may have the characteristic features at the following stages. Patients were first evaluated clinically with 12 features. Afterwards, skin samples were taken for the evaluation of 22 histopathological features. The values of the histopathological features are determined by an analysis of the samples under a microscope. 

In the dataset constructed for this domain, the family history feature has the value 1 if any of these diseases has been observed in the family, and 0 otherwise. The age feature simply represents the age of the patient. Every other feature (clinical and histopathological) was given a degree in the range of 0 to 3. Here, 0 indicates that the feature was not present, 3 indicates the largest amount possible, and 1, 2 indicate the relative intermediate values.

The names and id numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database.",,"G. Demiroz, H. A. Govenir, and N. Ilter, ""Learning Differential Diagnosis of Eryhemato-Squamous Diseases using Voting Feature Intervals"", Aritificial Intelligence in Medicine

34,Diabetes,"Michael Kahn, MD, PhD, Washington University, St. Louis, MO","Diabetes patient records were obtained from two sources:  an automatic electronic recording device and paper records.  The automatic device had an internal clock to timestamp events, whereas the paper records only provided ""logical time"" slots (breakfast, lunch, dinner, bedtime).  For paper records, fixed times were assigned to breakfast (08:00), lunch (12:00), dinner (18:00), and bedtime (22:00).  Thus paper records have fictitious uniform recording times whereas electronic records have more realistic time stamps.

Diabetes files consist of four fields per record.  Each field is separated by a tab and each record is separated by a newline.

(1) Date in MM-DD-YYYY format
(2) Time in XX:YY format
(3) Code
(4) Value

This database contains 352 bivariate numeric data sets collected from diverse sources and resulting, with a few exceptions, from investigations in physical science. For each data set, the collection includes:

1. Source: Bibliographic information for the source of the data.
2. Description: Identification of the variables $x$ and $y$.  Except in a few clearly identified instances, the abbreviated format $y$ vs. $x$ is employed.  An entry of the form

Description: Force vs. separation.
  
indicates that $x$ is a separation and $y$ is a force.  In some cases--when the information was readily available--the description also includes the units in which the data was originally reported.
     
3. Reference relation: The functional relationship proposed by the reporting scientist in the original source.

4. Comments (optional): Additional information pertaining to the case.

In recording reference relations, the database often omits details of parameter values.  If a scientist proposes $y=23.1x-.0014$, the reference relation may be given as just $y=k_{1}x+k_{2}$.  Also, since algebraic transformations have been employed freely, the same relation might be given as $y/x=k_{2}/x+k_{1}$.

In general, data collected here is given in full as it appeared in the original source.  Fractions have been converted to decimals, numbers have been freely translated to and from scientific notation and zeros have sometimes been added to decimal numbers to facilitate tabulation. Any additional deviations from verbatim transcription are noted in the Comments entry of the associated case.  Note in particular that, in a few clearly identified cases, apparent typographical errors have been corrected and that, in others, data points identified by the reporting scientist as *not* conforming to the proposed relationship have been omitted.",,"Cullen Schaffer, ""A Proven Domain-Independent Scientific Function-Finding Algorithm,"" in AAAI-90.

The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

Predicted attribute: class of iris plant.

This is an exceedingly simple domain.

This data differs from the data presented in Fishers article (identified by Steve Chadwick,  spchadwick@espeedaz.net ).  The 35th sample should be: 4.9,3.1,1.5,0.2,""Iris-setosa"" where the error is in the fourth feature.

Hinton used one unique output unit for each person and was interested in predicting the following relations: wife, husband, mother, father, daughter, son, sister, brother, aunt, uncle, niece, and nephew.  Hinton used 104 input-output vector pairs (from a space of 12x24=288 possible pairs).  The prediction task is as follows: given a name and a relation, have the outputs be on for only those individuals (among the 24) that satisfy the relation.  The outputs for all other individuals should be off.

Hinton's results: Using 100 vectors as input and 4 for testing, his results on two passes yielded 7 correct responses out of 8.  His network of 36 input units, 3 layers of hidden units, and 24 output units used 500 sweeps of the training set during training.

Splice junctions are points on a DNA sequence at which `superfluous' DNA is removed during the process of protein creation in higher organisms.  The problem posed in this dataset is to recognize, given a sequence of DNA, the boundaries between exons (the parts of the DNA sequence retained after splicing) and introns (the parts of the DNA sequence that are spliced out). This problem consists of two subtasks: recognizing exon/intron boundaries (referred to as EI sites), and recognizing intron/exon boundaries (IE sites). (In the biological community, IE borders are referred to a ``acceptors'' while EI borders are referred to as ``donors''.)

This dataset has been developed to help evaluate a ""hybrid"" learning algorithm (KBANN) that uses examples to inductively refine preexisting knowledge.  Using a ""ten-fold cross-validation"" methodology on 1000 examples randomly selected from the complete set of 3190, the following  error rates were produced by various ML algorithms (all experiments run at the Univ of Wisconsin, sometimes with local implementations of published algorithms).

One significant characteristic of this comparison is that it was performed by a collection of researchers, each of whom was an advocate of the technique they tested (often they were the creators of the various methods). In this sense, the results are less biased than in comparisons performed by a single person advocating a specific learning method, and more accurately reflect the generalization behavior of the learning techniques as applied by knowledgeable users.

There are three MONK's problems.  The domains for all MONK's problems are the same (described below).  One of the MONK's problems has noise added. For each problem, the domain has been partitioned into a train and test set.",,"Wnek, J., ""Hypothesis-driven Constructive Induction,"" PhD dissertation, School of Information Technology and Engineering, Reports of Machine Learning and Inference Laboratory, MLI 93-2, Center for Artificial Intelligence, George Mason University, March 1993.

Blaz Zupan      (blaz.zupan@ijs.si)","Nursery Database was derived from a hierarchical decision model originally developed to rank applications for nursery schools. It was used during several years in 1980's when there was excessive enrollment to these schools in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and the rejected applications frequently needed an objective explanation. The final decision depended on three subproblems: occupation of parents and child's nursery, family structure and financial standing, and social and health picture of the family. The model was developed within expert system shell for decision making DEX (M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.).

The hierarchical model ranks nursery-school applications according to the following concept structure:

 NURSERY            Evaluation of applications for nursery schools
 . EMPLOY           Employment of parents and child's nursery
 . . parents        Parents' occupation
 . . has_nurs       Child's nursery
 . STRUCT_FINAN     Family structure and financial standings
 . . STRUCTURE      Family structure
 . . . form         Form of the family
 . . . children     Number of children
 . . housing        Housing conditions
 . . finance        Financial standing of the family
 . SOC_HEALTH       Social and health picture of the family
 . . social         Social conditions
 . . health         Health conditions

Input attributes are printed in lowercase. Besides the target concept (NURSERY) the model includes four intermediate concepts: EMPLOY, STRUCT_FINAN, STRUCTURE, SOC_HEALTH. Every concept is in the original model related to its lower level descendants by a set of examples (for these examples sets see http://www-ai.ijs.si/BlazZupan/nursery.html).

The Nursery Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates NURSERY to the eight input attributes: parents, has_nurs, form, children, housing, finance, social, health.

alpaydin@boun.edu.tr","We create a digit database by collecting 250 samples from 44 writers. The samples written by 30 writers are used for training, cross-validation and writer dependent testing, and the digits written by the other 14 are used for writer independent testing. This database is also available in the UNIPEN format.

We use a WACOM PL-100V pressure sensitive tablet with an integrated LCD display and a cordless stylus. The input and display areas are located in the same place. Attached to the serial port of an Intel 486 based PC, it allows us to collect handwriting samples. The tablet sends $x$ and $y$ tablet coordinates and pressure level values of the pen at fixed time intervals (sampling rate) of 100 miliseconds. 

These writers are asked to write 250 digits in random order inside boxes of 500 by 500 tablet pixel resolution.  Subject are monitored only during the first entry screens. Each screen contains five boxes with the digits to be written displayed above. Subjects are told to write only inside these boxes.  If they make a mistake or are unhappy with their writing, they are instructed to clear the content of a box by using an on-screen button. The first ten digits are ignored because most writers are not familiar with this type of input devices, but subjects are not aware of this. 

In our study, we use only ($x, y$) coordinate information. The stylus pressure level values are ignored. First we apply normalization to make our representation invariant to translations and scale distortions. The raw data that we capture from the tablet consist of integer values between 0 and 500 (tablet input box resolution). The new coordinates are such that the coordinate which has the maximum range varies between 0 and 100. Usually $x$ stays in this range, since most characters are taller than they are wide.  

In order to train and test our classifiers, we need to represent digits as constant length feature vectors. A commonly used technique leading to good results is resampling the ( x_t, y_t) points. Temporal resampling (points regularly spaced in time) or spatial resampling (points regularly spaced in arc length) can be used here. Raw point data are already regularly spaced in time but the distance between them is variable. Previous research showed that spatial resampling to obtain a constant number of regularly spaced points on the trajectory yields much better performance, because it provides a better alignment between points. Our resampling algorithm uses simple linear interpolation between pairs of points. The resampled digits are represented as a sequence of T points ( x_t, y_t )_{t=1}^T, regularly spaced in arc length, as opposed to the input sequence, which is regularly spaced in time.

So, the input vector size is 2*T, two times the number of points resampled. We considered spatial resampling to T=8,12,16 points in our experiments and found that T=8 gave the best trade-off between accuracy and complexity.",,"F.

Instances have 8 components: neck, four legs, torso, head, and tail.  Each component is represented as a simplified/generalized cylinder (i.e., inspired by David Marr's work in ""Vision: A Computational Investigation Into the Human Representation  and Processing of Visual Information"", published by Freeman in 1982). Each cylinder is itself described by 9 attributes: location x 3, axis x 3, height, radius, and texture.  This code generates instances in one of four classes: dogs, cats, horses, and giraffes.  The program generates instances by selecting a class according to a distribution determined by function rand4().  Each class has a prototype; the prototype of the selected class is perturbed according to a distribution described in the code for the four classes (i.e., parameterized means with Guassian distributions are used to represent prototypes and perturbation distributions, where the means are used to distinguish the four classes).

From John Gennari: (1990)

The only notes I have about it is that I don't use the data format it creates any more. To change this, modify ""printpart()"". Also, it uses a very rough approximation for a bell-shaped distribution. Currently, I use a much more sophisticated random number generator. To fix this, just replace ""bellrand()"" with a real bell shaped distribution.",,

I do not have that paper, but have found what is probably a later variation of that figure in Stepp's dissertation, which lists the value ""normal"" for the first 2 classes and ""irrelevant"" for the latter 2 classes.  I believe that ""irrelevant"" is used here as a synonym for ""not-applicable"", ""dna"", and ""does-not-apply"".  I believe that there is a mis-print in the figure he read in their PAMI-83 article.

Donor: 

David Draper (draper@math.ucla.edu)","There are two databases: (both use the same set of 5 attributes):
1. Primary o-ring erosion and/or blowby
2. Primary o-ring erosion only

The two databases are identical except for the 2nd attribute of the 21st instance (confirmed by David Draper on 8/5/93).

Edited from (Draper, 1993):

The motivation for collecting this database was the explosion of the USA Space Shuttle Challenger on 28 January, 1986.  An investigation ensued into the reliability of the shuttle's propulsion system.  The explosion was eventually traced to the failure of one of the three field joints on one of the two solid booster rockets.  Each of these six field joints includes two O-rings, designated as primary and secondary, which fail when phenomena called erosion and blowby both occur. 

The night before the launch a decision had to be made regarding launch safety.  The discussion among engineers and managers leading to this decision included concern that the probability of failure of the O-rings depended on the temperature t at launch, which was forecase to be 31 degrees F. There are strong engineering reasons based on the composition of O-rings to support the judgment that failure probability may rise monotonically as temperature drops.  One other variable, the pressure s at which safety testing for field join leaks was performed, was available, but its relevance to the failure process was unclear.
       
Draper's paper includes a menacing figure graphing the number of field joints experiencing stress vs. liftoff temperature for the 23 shuttle flights previous to the Challenger disaster.  No previous liftoff temperature was under 53 degrees F.  Although tremendous extrapolation must be done from the given data to assess risk at 31 degrees F, it is obvious even to the layman ""to foresee the unacceptably high risk created by launching at 31 degrees F.""  For more information, see Draper (1993) or the other previous analyses.
       
The task is to predict the number of O-rings that will experience thermal distress for a given flight when the launch temperature is below freezing.",,"Draper,D. (1993).

John Stutz <STUTZ@pluto.arc.nasa.gov> 
It's possible that one of John's colleagues actually provided this to UCI, perhaps Mike Marshall (MARSHALL%PLU@io.arc.nasa.gov)","The Infra-Red Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) was the first attempt to map the full sky at infra-red wavelengths.  This could not be done from ground observatories because large portions of the infra-red spectrum is absorbed by the atmosphere.  The primary observing program was the full high resolution sky mapping performed by scanning at 4 frequencies. The Low Resolution Observation (IRAS-LRS) program observed high intensity sources over two continuous spectral bands.  This database derives from a subset of the higher quality LRS observations taken between 12h and 24h right ascension. 

This database contains 531 high quality spectra derived from the IRAS-LRS database.  The original data contained 100 spectral measurements in each of two overlapping bands.  Of these, 44 blue band and 49 red band channels contain usable flux measurements.  Only these are included here.  The original spectral intensities values are compressed to 4-digits, and each spectrum includes 5 rescaling parameters.  We have used the LRS specified algorithm to rescale these to units of spectral intensity (Janskys).  Total intensity differences have been eliminated by normalizing each spectrum to a mean value of 5000.
	
This database was originally obtained for use in development and testing of our AutoClass system for Bayesian classification.  We have not retained any results from this development, having concentrated our efforts of a 5425 element version of the same data.  Our classifications were based upon simultaneous modeling of all 93 spectral intensities. With the larger database we were able to find classes that correspond well with known spectral types associated with particular stellar types. We also found classes that match with the spectra expected of certain stellar processes under investigation by Ames astronomers.  These classes have considerably enlarged the set of stars being investigated by those researchers.  

Original Data:

The original fortran data file is given in spectra-2.data.  The file spectra-2.head contains information about the .data file contents and how to rescale the compressed spectral intensities.

- Additional ""background"" knowledge is supplied that provides a partial ordering on some of the attribute values.

- We are providing this dataset both in its original form and in a form similar to the more typical propositional datasets in our repository. Since the trains dataset records relations between attributes, this transformation was somewhat challenging.  However, it may shed some insight on this problem for people who are more familiar with the simple one-instance-per-line dataset format.

","The source of the data is the raw measurements from a Nintendo PowerGlove. It was interfaced through a PowerGlove Serial Interface to a Silicon Graphics 4D/35G workstation. 

This glove definitely falls into the category of ""cheap and nasty"". Position information is calculated on the basis of ultrasound emissions from emitters the glove to a 3-microphone ""L-Bar"" that sits atop a monitor. There are two emitters on the glove; and three receivers. This allows the calculation of 4 pieces of information: x (left/right), y (up/down), z (backward/forward), and roll (is the palm pointing up or down?). x, y and z are measured with 8 bit accuracy. ""x, y, z"" should not be taken to be the normal 3-dimensional orthogonal basis. In particular, 1 unit in the z direction is not of similar distance to 1 unit in the x or y directions. These x, y, z positions are relative to a calibration point which is when the palm is resting on the seated signer's thigh. Roll is 4 bits. 

The data is susceptible to occasional ""spikes"" caused by random ultrasound noise. Median filters have been found to be beneficial in solving this problem. 

Finger bend is generated by conductive bend sensors on the first four fingers. Values vary between 0 (straight) and 3 (fully bent). Accuracy is 2 bits. The gloves automatically apply a hysteresis filter on these bend sensors. At best, these measurements should be treated sceptically. 

See past usage for a more detailed discussion on the data collection methodology. 

The data was collected from five signers: 
 
Signer -- Description -- Sessions -- Total samples/sign

 Adam -- Sign linguist - PhD completed in area. -- 2 -- 8
 Andrew -- Natural signer - signing since youth -- 3 -- 8
 John -- Professional Auslan interpreter -- 5 -- 18
 Stephen -- Professional Auslan interpreter -- 4  -- 16
 Waleed -- The researcher. Novice signer -- 4 -- 20

Each session was taken at a different time, after a break, etc. 

The ""adam"" dataset were sampled in a fixed order -- this means that they are subject to fatigue effects, etc. All other datasets were sampled in random order. The ""waleed"" and ""stephen"" datasets contain signs that begin with ""cal-"". These were considered as a means of calibration, but didn't work out too well. 

The data presented is the raw data with no filtering. 

Occasional dropouts in x, y, z values. These can be easily fixed using a median filter. 

Average number of frames per instance is 51, but varies from 30 to 102. 

The data is in a comma separated file containing all of the attributes mentioned above. Each sign sample is stored in a single file. The directory hierarchy is as follows: 
-Each signer is in a separate directory. 
-Each session from signer is in a subdirectory. Each session is denoted by a number. 
-Each sample is in a file named by the sample appended with the number of the sample of that sign. 

The filenames indicate the class. ","The data may be used provided that:

","Data was captured using a setup that consisted of: 

- Two Fifth Dimension Technologies (5DT) gloves, one right and one left 
- Two Ascension Flock-of-Birds magnetic position trackers, one attached to each hand 
- A four-port serial card to cope with four data sources 
- A PC (128MB RAM, Intel Pentium II 266MHz) was used 

In terms of the quality of the data, the Flock system was far superior to the Nintendo system also available from the same donor. Firstly, this was a two-hand system. Secondly, each position tracker provided 6 degrees of freedom - i.e. roll, pitch and yaw as well as x, y and z. The gloves also provided a full five fingers of data. But the big improvements were in resolution - both accuracy and temporal. Position and orientation were defined to 14-bit accuracy, giving position information with a typical positional error less than one centimetre and angle error less than one half of a degree. Finger bend was measured with 8 bits per finger, of which probably 6 bits were usable once the glove was calibrated. The refresh rate of the complete system was close to 100 frames per second; and all signals had significantly less noise than the Nintendo data. 

Samples from a single signer (a native Auslan signer) were collected over a period of nine weeks. In total, 27 samples per sign, and a total of 2565 signs were collected. The average length of each sign was approximately 57 frames. 

The data was collected from a volunteer native Auslan signer 

The data presented is the raw data with no filtering. 

The file consists of 9 subdirectories tctodd1-9. Each directory consists of 3 samples of each sign, captured on a different day. In total there are 95 different signs, with 27 samples per sign. Signs were provided by a native signer volunteer. 

Each file consists of a sequence of lines. Each line consists of 22 whitespace-separated numbers representing the 22 channels of information. The list of channels can be found in the domain description file. It also lists the classes. More information can be found here: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~waleed/phd/html/node126.html.

","This data arises from a large study to examine EEG correlates of genetic predisposition to alcoholism. It contains measurements from 64 electrodes placed on subject's scalps which were sampled at 256 Hz (3.9-msec epoch) for 1 second. 

There were two groups of subjects: alcoholic and control. Each subject was exposed to either a single stimulus (S1) or to two stimuli (S1 and S2) which were pictures of objects chosen from the 1980 Snodgrass and Vanderwart picture set. When two stimuli were shown, they were presented in either a matched condition where S1 was identical to S2 or in a non-matched condition where S1 differed from S2. 

Shown here are example plots of a control (http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/eeg/control.gif) and alcoholic (http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/eeg/alcoholic.gif) subject. The plots indicate voltage, time, and channel and are averaged over 10 trials for the single stimulus condition. 

There were 122 subjects and each subject completed 120 trials where different stimuli were shown. The electrode positions were located at standard sites (Standard Electrode Position Nomenclature, American Electroencephalographic Association 1990). Zhang et al. (1995) describes in detail the data collection process. 

There are three versions of the EEG data set. 

1. The Small Data Set
The small data set (smni97_eeg_data.tar.gz) contains data for the 2 subjects, alcoholic a_co2a0000364 and control c_co2c0000337. For each of the 3 matching paradigms, c_1 (one presentation only), c_m (match to previous presentation) and c_n (no-match to previous presentation), 10 runs are shown. 

2.  The Large Data Set
The large data set (SMNI_CMI_TRAIN.tar.gz and SMNI_CMI_TEST.tar.gz) contains data for 10 alcoholic and 10 control subjects, with 10 runs per subject per paradigm. The test data used the same 10 alcoholic and 10 control subjects as with the training data, but with 10 out-of-sample runs per subject per paradigm. 

3. The Full Data Set
This data set contains all 120 trials for 122 subjects. The entire set of data is about 700 MBytes. 

NOTE: There are 17 trials with empty files in co2c1000367. Some trials have ""err"" notices, e.g., search/grep for ""err"" and see ""S2 match err"" or ""S2 nomatch err"" etc.

","This data was collected with the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) array which was developed by the international Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere (TOGA) program. The TAO array consists of nearly 70 moored buoys spanning the equatorial Pacific, measuring oceanographic and surface meteorological variables critical for improved detection, understanding and prediction of seasonal-to-interannual climate variations originating in the tropics, most notably those related to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles. 

The moorings were developed by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL). Each mooring measures air temperature, relative humidity, surface winds, sea surface temperatures and subsurface temperatures down to a depth of 500 meters and a few a of the buoys measure currents, rainfall and solar radiation. The data from the array, and current updates, can be viewed on the web at the this address . 

The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle of 1982-1983, the strongest of the century, created many problems throughout the world. Parts of the world such as Peru and the Unites States experienced destructive flooding from increased rainfalls while the western Pacific areas experienced drought and devastating brush fires. The ENSO cycle was neither predicted nor detected until it was near its peak. This highlighted the need for an ocean observing system (i.e. the TAO array) to support studies of large scale ocean-atmosphere interactions on seasonal-to-interannual time scales. 

The TAO array provides real-time data to climate researchers, weather prediction centers and scientists around the world. Forcasts for tropical Pacific Ocean temperatures for one to two years in advance can be made using the ENSO cycle data. These forcasts are possible because of the moored buoys, along with drifting buoys, volunteer ship temperature probes, and sea level measurements. 

Research questions of interest include: 

- How can the data be used to predict weather conditions throughout the world? 
- How do the variables relate to each other? 
- Which variables have a greater effect on the climate variations? 
- Does the amount of movement of the buoy effect the reliability of the data? 
- When performing an analysis of the data, one should pay attention the possible affect of autocorrelation. Using a multiple regression approach to model the data would require a look at autoregression since the weather statistics of the previous days will affect today's weather. 

The data is stored in an ASCII files with one observation per line. Spaces separate fields and periods (.) denote missing values.

Now here:
http://josquin.cti.depaul.edu/~rburke/","This data records interactions with Entree Chicago restaurant recommendation system (originally http://infolab.cs.uchicago.edu/entree) from September, 1996 to April, 1999. The data is organized into files roughly spanning a quarter year -- with Q3 1996 and Q2 1999 each only containing one month. 

Each line in a session file represents a session of user interaction with the system. The (tab-separated) fields are as follows: 

     Date, IP, Entry point, Rated restaurant1, ..., Rated restaurantN, End point

1. Entry point:

Users can use a restaurant from any city as a entry point, but they always get recommendations for Chicago restaurants. The entry point therefore draws from a larger universe of restaurants than the rest of the data. 
Entry points have the form nnnX, where nnn is a numeric restaurant ID and X is a character A-H that encodes the city. 

     A = Atlanta
     B = Boston
     C = Chicago
     D = Los Angeles
     E = New Orleans
     F = New York
     G = San Francisco
     H = Washington DC

2. Rated Restaurant:

These are all Chicago restaurants. 
These entries have the form nnnX, where nnn is a numeric restaurant ID and X is a character L-T that encodes the navigation operation. 

     L = browse (move from one restaurant in a list of recommendations to another)
     M = cheaper (search for a restaurant like this one, but cheaper)
     N = nicer   (         ""               ""           , but nicer)
     O = closer  (unused in the production version of the system)
     P = more traditional (search for a restaurant like this, but serving more traditional cuisine)
     Q = more creative (search for a restaurant serving more creative cuisine)
     R = more lively (search for a restaurant with a livelier atmosphere)
     S = quieter (search for a restaurant with a quieter atmosphere)
     T = change cuisine (search for a restaurant like this, but serving a different kind of food) Note that with this tweak, we would ideally like to know what cuisine the user wanted to change to, but this information was not recorded.

3. End point:

Just the numeric id for the (Chicago) restaurant that the user saw last. In our experiments, we are assuming that this was a good suggestion, but it is also possible that user just gives up. 
Some potentially useful data is missing. In many cases, we don't know the starting point because the user input a set of selection criteria (such as ""inexpensive traditional Mexican"") using a form submission, rather than starting from a known restaurant. These queries were not recorded. This is denoted by a 0 in the entry point field. Some sessions do not have a known end point. This is marked by -1 in the end point field. 


In addition to the user's interactions, there is also data linking the restaurant ID with its name and features such as ""fabulous wine lists"", ""good for younger kids"", and ""Ethopian"" cuisine. This data is stored by city (e.g. Atlanta, Boston, etc.) and is in the following format: 

    restaurant id [tab] restaurant name [tab] restaurant features (3 digits ids separated by spaces)

","Each image can be characterized by the pose, expression, eyes, and size. There are 32 images for each person capturing every combination of features. 

To view the images, you can use the program xv. 

The image data can be found in /faces. This directory contains 20 subdirectories, one for each person, named by userid. Each of these directories contains several different face images of the same person. 

You will be interested in the images with the following naming convention: 

<userid> <pose> <expression> <eyes> <scale>.pgm 
<userid> is the user id of the person in the image, and this field has 20 values: an2i, at33, boland, bpm, ch4f, cheyer, choon, danieln, glickman, karyadi, kawamura, kk49, megak, mitchell, night, phoebe, saavik, steffi, sz24, and tammo. 
<pose> is the head position of the person, and this field has 4 values: straight, left, right, up. 
<expression> is the facial expression of the person, and this field has 4 values: neutral, happy, sad, angry. 
<eyes> is the eye state of the person, and this field has 2 values: open, sunglasses. 
<scale> is the scale of the image, and this field has 3 values: 1, 2, and 4. 1 indicates a full-resolution image (128 columns by 120 rows); 2 indicates a half-resolution image (64 by 60); 4 indicates a quarter-resolution image (32 by 30). 
If you've been looking closely in the image directories, you may notice that some images have a .bad suffix rather than the .pgm suffix. As it turns out, 16 of the 640 images taken have glitches due to problems with the camera setup; these are the .bad images. Some people had more glitches than others, but everyone who got ``faced'' should have at least 28 good face images (out of the 32 variations possible, discounting scale).

","The original source for this data set is the IPUMS project (RugglesSobek, 1997). The IPUMS project is a large collection of federal census data which has standardized coding schemes to make comparisons across time easy.

The data is an unweighted 1 in 100 sample of responses from the Los Angeles -- Long Beach area for the years 1970, 1980, and 1990. The household and individual records were flattened into a single table and we used all variables that were available for all three years. When there was more than one version of a variable, such as for race, we used the most general. For occupation and industry we used the 1950 basis.

Note that PUMS data is based on cluster samples, i.e. samples are made of households or dwellings from which there may be multiple individuals. Individuals from the same household are no longer independent. Ruggles (1995) considers this issue further and discusses its effect (along with the effects of stratification) on standard errors.

The variable schltype appears to have different coding values across the years 1970, 1980, and 1990.

There are two versions of this data set:

1. The Small Data Set

The small data set contains a 1 in 1000 sample of the Los Angeles and Long Beach area. It was formed by sampling from the large data set.

","The data was collected for examining our newly developed classifier for multidimensional curves (multidimensional time series). Nine male speakers uttered two Japanese vowels /ae/ successively. For each utterance, with the analysis parameters described below, we applied 12-degree linear prediction analysis to it to obtain a discrete-time series with 12 LPC cepstrum coefficients. This means that one utterance by a speaker forms a time series whose length is in the range 7-29 and each point of a time series is of 12 features (12 coefficients).

The number of the time series is 640 in total. We used one set of 270 time series for training and the other set of 370 time series for testing.

Number of Instances (Utterances):

    * Training: 270 (30 utterances by 9 speakers. See file 'size_ae.train'.)
    * Testing: 370 (24-88 utterances by the same 9 speakers in different opportunities. See file 'size_ae.test'.) 

Length of Time Series:

    * 7 - 29 depending on utterances 

Analysis parameters:

    * Sampling rate : 10kHz
    * Frame length : 25.6 ms
    * Shift length : 6.4ms
    * Degree of LPC coefficients : 12 

Files:

    * Training file: ae.train
    * Testing file: ae.test 

Format:

Each line in ae.train or ae.test represents 12 LPC coefficients in the increasing order separated by spaces. This corresponds to one analysis frame.

Lines are organized into blocks, which are a set of 7-29 lines separated by blank lines and corresponds to a single speech utterance of /ae/ with 7-29 frames.

Each speaker is a set of consecutive blocks. In ae.train there are 30 blocks for each speaker. Blocks 1-30 represent speaker 1, blocks 31-60 represent speaker 2, and so on up to speaker 9. In ae.test, speakers 1 to 9 have the corresponding number of blocks: 31 35 88 44 29 24 40 50 29. Thus, blocks 1-31 represent speaker 1 (31 utterances of /ae/), blocks 32-66 represent speaker 2 (35 utterances of /ae/), and so on.","If you publish any work using the dataset, please inform the donor.

http://users.aber.ac.uk/rdk","The data was collected from several sources, including the Sanger Centre (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/M_tuberculosis/Gene_list/) and SWISSPROT (http://www.expasy.ch/sprot/sprot-top.html). Structure prediction was made by PROF (http://www.aber.ac.uk/~phiwww/prof/index.html). Homology search was made by PSI-BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/).

The data is in Datalog format. Missing values are not explicit, but some genes have more relationships than others.

Dependencies:

M. tuberculosis genes (ORFs) are related to each other by the predicate tb_to_tb_evalue(TBNumber,E-value). They are related to other (SWISSPROT) proteins by the predicate e_val(AccNo,E-value). All the data for a single gene (ORF) is enclosed between delimiters of the form:

   begin(model(TBNumber)).
   end(model(TBNumber)).

Other Relevant Information:

The gene functional classes are in a hierarchy. See http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/M_tuberculosis/Gene_list/.


There are two datalog files: tb_data.pl and ecoli_functions.pl

1. tb_functions.pl

Lists classes and ORF functions. Lines are of the following form:

   class([1,0,0,0],""Small-molecule metabolism "").
   class([1,1,0,0],""Degradation "").
   class([1,1,1,0],""Carbon compounds "").  

Arguments are a list of 4 numbers (describing class at the 4 different levels), followed by a string class description. For example,

   function(tb186,[1,1,1,0],'bglS',""beta-glucosidase""). 

Arguments are ORF number, list of 4 class numbers, gene name (or null if no gene name) in single quotes, ORF description in double quotes.

2. tb_data.pl

Data for each ORF (gene) is delimited by

   begin(model(X)).
   end(model(X)).

where X is the ORF number. Other predicates are as follows (examples):

   tb_protein(X).    % X is gene number

","The data is stored in relational form across several files. The central file (MAIN) is a list of movies, each with a unique identifier. These identifiers may change in successive versions. The actors (CAST) for those movies are listed with their roles in a distinct file. More information about individual actors (ACTORS) is in a third file. All directors in MAIN are listed in a fourth file (PEOPLE), with a number of important producers, writers, and cinematographers. A fifth file (REMAKES) links movies that were copied to a substantial extent from each other. The sixth file (STUDIOS) provides some information about studios shown in MAIN.

The original motivation was for database class exercises, to replace the boring `manager of the toy-department' queries. Note that the CASTS, refering MAIN and ACTORS is logically identical to the inventory file refering to suppliers and assemblies in the the standard bill-of-materials problems. Personal interests caused the database to be made complete for all Hitchcock movies and TV episodes. Related films by type and actor were added gradually.

Subsequent research on temporal databases caused date fields (years only) to be added. It allows testing, say, if the dates-of-work of an ACTOR match the dates of the MAIN films that the CAST relation shows. Object-oriented database features could be tested with fields having multiple and two-level values, as documented in DOC.

The entries were gradually collected during course work starting about 1975 and are still being updated. Most of the entries were manual. The DOC file lists some of the reference works used. Corrections and additions continue to be appreciated.

Detailed descriptions of the fields and their formats is provided in doc.html. 

Missing Values:

Outside of key fields, missing values are common. Their encoding is described in DOC. Sometimes the data seems to be unavailable, sometimes it hasn't been entered. Some information, as `lived-with' is inherently incomplete.

Censored Data:

Minor actors are ignored.

Dependencies:

Every MAIN film must have a director in PEOPLE. About 50 pseudo director names ahve been listed in PEOPLE to allow interesting films to with (yet) unknown directors to be entered. Every CASTS entry must relate to a MAIN film entry. Every ACTOR should appear in some CASTS entry, but not vice versa. See DOC for more type information.

Other Relevant Information:

Films are listed, if known, with their original language title. An Alt(T: ) field provides English translations, where known.

Data Format:

The current files are in HTML, to allow easy parsing to other formats. An XML version is being considered.

The approximate file sizes are:

Our hope was to cover most of the types of sensory interactions that a Pioneer might be reasonably expected to encounter: things like passing by visible objects, pushing visible objects, crashing into walls, etc. Many of these interactions are repeated throughout the dataset.

This data was collected to serve as the basis for work in learning and conceptual development. Our first goal was to be able to have the robot cluster these experiences by their dynamics on their own into clusters of experiences with a common outcome.

Each data file contains time series data in which each row of data corresponds to a single observation of the sensor array. Included in each row are two additional variables, 'id' and 'description', which indicate the experience number that the observation belongs to, and a description of that experience, respectively. Observations within an experience are taken every 100ms. 

The data is stored in three text files: one file for experiences in which the Pioneer was moving in a straight line, one in which it was turning in place, and one in which it was raising or lowering its gripper.

The description variable is a string of symbols. The string breaks down as follows:

""u"" or ""o"" -  unobstructed or obstructed
""x.xs""     -  activity lasted x.x seconds
activity   -  the activity and speed, if applicable, i.e. move100 = move forward at 100mm/sec
visual     -  objects in the visual array are listed in sequence. ""cAHEAD"" indicates an object visible to channel c directly AHEAD of the Pioneer.
[visual.X] -  visual descriptions followed by a '.' and one character indicate that something special happens with the visible object. .V means the object Vanishes from sight during the activity. .D indicates that the object is Discovered (becomes visible) during the activity. .P indicates that the object is pushed. 

An example: ""u-3.5s-retr-100-aRIGHT.D""  An unobstructed retreat (move) at -100 mm/sec for 3.5 seconds with an object being discovered in channel A.

It should be noted that, particularly with respect to the visual channels, the description may not be 100% accurate. Since the visual channels respond to colors that they are trained on (visual a=red, visual b=yellow, visual c=blue), it was possible, but infrequent, for some extraneous object in the environment generated a response in visual channels that were not supposed to show activity in a particular trial.

","This data set is designed for testing indexing schemes in time series databases. It is a much larger dataset than has been used in any published study (That we are currently aware of). It contains one million data points. The data has been split into 10 sections to facilitate testing (see below). We recommend building the index with 9 of the 100,000-datapoint sections, and randomly extracting a query shape from the 10th section. (Some previously published work seems to have used queries that were also used to build the indexing structure. This will produce optimistic results) The data are interesting because they have structure at different resolutions. Each of the 10 sections where generated by independent invocations of the function: (see equation.gif)

137,Reuters-21578 Text Categorization Collection,"David D. Lewis
AT&T Labs - Research     
lewis@research.att.com

Documents came from Reuters newswire in 1987.","From the original readme file (please consult it for more information):
-------------------------
The documents in the Reuters-21578 collection appeared on the Reuters newswire in 1987.  The documents were assembled and indexed with categories by personnel from Reuters Ltd. (Sam Dobbins, Mike Topliss, Steve Weinstein) and Carnegie Group, Inc. (Peggy Andersen, Monica Cellio, Phil Hayes, Laura Knecht, Irene Nirenburg) in 1987.  

In 1990, the documents were made available by Reuters and CGI for research purposes to the Information Retrieval Laboratory (W.  Bruce Croft, Director) of the Computer and Information Science Department at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.  Formatting of the documents and production of associated data files was done in 1990 by David D.  Lewis and Stephen Harding at the Information Retrieval Laboratory.

Further formatting and data file production was done in 1991 and 1992 by David D. Lewis and Peter Shoemaker at the Center for Information and Language Studies, University of Chicago.  This version of the data was made available for anonymous FTP as ""Reuters-22173, Distribution 1.0"" in January 1993. From 1993 through 1996, Distribution 1.0 was hosted at a succession of FTP sites maintained by the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (W. Bruce Croft, Director) of the Computer Science Department at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

At the ACM SIGIR '96 conference in August, 1996 a group of text categorization researchers discussed how published results on Reuters-22173 could be made more comparable across studies.  It was decided that a new version of collection should be produced with less ambiguous formatting, and including documentation carefully spelling out standard methods of using the collection.  The opportunity would also be used to correct a variety of typographical and other errors in the categorization and formatting of the collection.

Steve Finch and David D. Lewis did this cleanup of the collection September through November of 1996, relying heavily on Finch's SGML-tagged version of the collection from an earlier study.  One result of the re-examination of the collection was the removal of 595 documents which were exact duplicates (based on identity of timestamps down to the second) of other documents in the collection. The new collection therefore has only 21,578 documents, and thus is called the Reuters-21578 collection.  This README describes version 1.0 of this new collection, which we refer to as ""Reuters-21578, Distribution 1.0"".

In preparing the collection and documentation we have benefited from discussions with Eric Brown, William Cohen, Fred Damerau, Yoram Singer, Amit Singhal, and Yiming Yang, among many others.

We thank all the people and organizations listed above for their efforts and support, without which this collection would not exist.","The copyright for the text of newswire articles and Reuters annotations in the Reuters-21578 collection resides with Reuters Ltd.

The objective of the mission was to obtain global mapping of the surface of Venus using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). A more detailed discussion of the mission and objectives is available at  JPL's Magellan webpage.

There are some spatial dependencies. For example, background patches from with in a single image are likely to be more similar than background patches taken across different images.

In addition to the images, there are ""ground truth"" files that specify the locations of volcanoes within the images. The quotes around ""ground truth"" are intended as a reminder that there is no absolute ground truth for this data set. No one has been to Venus and the image quality does not permit 100%, unambiguous identification of the volcanoes, even by human experts. There are labels that provide some measure of subjective uncertainty (1 = definitely a volcano, 2 = probably, 3 = possibly, 4 = only a pit is visible). See reference [Smyth95] for more information on the labeling uncertainty problem.

There are also files that specify the exact set of experiments using in the published evaluations of the JARtool system. 

The image files are in a format called VIEW. This format consists of two files, a binary file with extension .sdt (the image data) and an ascii file with extension .spr (header information). There is a MATLAB utility function included in the data package that can be used to read the data. If you want to use something other than Matlab, you are on your own, but the format is fairly simple and can be understood by looking at the Matlab code.

The labeling files are provided in two forms. The .lxyr files are simple space-separated ascii containing label, x-location of center, y-location of center, and radius. ",,"G.H. Pettengill, P.G.

	The original Landsat data for this database was generated
	from data purchased from NASA by the Australian Centre
	for Remote Sensing, and used for research at:
		The Centre for Remote Sensing
		University of New South Wales
		Kensington, PO Box 1
		NSW 2033
		Australia.

     The sample database was generated taking a small section (82
     rows and 100 columns) from the original data. The binary values
     were converted to their present ASCII form by Ashwin Srinivasan.
     The classification for each pixel was performed on the basis of
     an actual site visit by Ms. Karen Hall, when working for Professor
     John A. Richards, at the Centre for Remote Sensing at the University
     of New South Wales, Australia. Conversion to 3x3 neighbourhoods and
     splitting into test and training sets was done by Alistair Sutherland.
","The database consists of the multi-spectral values of pixels in 3x3 neighbourhoods in a satellite image, and the classification associated with the central pixel in each neighbourhood. The aim is to predict this classification, given the multi-spectral values. In the sample database, the class of a pixel is coded as a number.

The Landsat satellite data is one of the many sources of information available for a scene. The interpretation of a scene by integrating spatial data of diverse types and resolutions including multispectral and radar data, maps indicating topography, land use etc. is expected to assume significant importance with the onset of an era characterised by integrative approaches to remote sensing (for example, NASA's Earth Observing System commencing this decade). Existing statistical methods are ill-equipped for handling such diverse data types. Note that this is not true for Landsat MSS data considered in isolation (as in this sample database). This data satisfies the important requirements of being numerical and at a single resolution, and standard maximum-likelihood classification performs very well. Consequently, for this data, it should be interesting to compare the performance of other methods against the statistical approach.

One frame of Landsat MSS imagery consists of four digital images of the same scene in different spectral bands. Two of these are in the visible region (corresponding approximately to green and red regions of the visible spectrum) and two are in the (near) infra-red. Each pixel is a 8-bit binary word, with 0 corresponding to black and 255 to white. The spatial resolution of a pixel is about 80m x 80m. Each image contains 2340 x 3380 such pixels.

The database is a (tiny) sub-area of a scene, consisting of 82 x 100 pixels. Each line of data corresponds to a 3x3 square neighbourhood of pixels completely contained within the 82x100 sub-area. Each line contains the pixel values in the four spectral bands (converted to ASCII) of each of the 9 pixels in the 3x3 neighbourhood and a number indicating the classification label of the central pixel. The number is a code for the following classes:

Number			Class
1			red soil
2			cotton crop
3			grey soil
4			damp grey soil
5			soil with vegetation stubble
6			mixture class (all types present)
7			very damp grey soil
	
NB. There are no examples with class 6 in this dataset.

The data is given in random order and certain lines of data have been removed so you cannot reconstruct the original image from this dataset.

In each line of data the four spectral values for the top-left pixel are given first followed by the four spectral values for the top-middle pixel and then those for the top-right pixel, and so on with the pixels read out in sequence left-to-right and top-to-bottom. Thus, the four spectral values for the central pixel are given by attributes 17,18,19 and 20. If you like you can use only these four attributes, while ignoring the others. This avoids the problem which arises when a 3x3 neighbourhood straddles a boundary.

","The purpose is to classify a given silhouette as one of four types of vehicle, using  a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.  

HISTORY:

This data was originally gathered at the TI in 1986-87 by JP Siebert. It was partially financed by Barr and Stroud Ltd. The original purpose was to find a method of distinguishing 3D objects within a 2D image by application of an ensemble of shape feature extractors to the 2D silhouettes of the objects. Measures of shape features extracted from example silhouettes of objects to be discriminated were used to generate a classification rule tree by means of computer induction.

This object recognition strategy was successfully used to discriminate between silhouettes of model cars, vans and buses viewed from constrained elevation but all angles of rotation.

The rule tree classification performance compared favourably to MDC (Minimum Distance Classifier) and k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbour) statistical classifiers in terms of both error rate and computational efficiency. An investigation of these rule trees generated by example indicated that the tree structure was heavily influenced by the orientation of the objects, and grouped similar object views into single decisions.


DESCRIPTION:

The features were extracted from the silhouettes by the HIPS (Hierarchical Image Processing System) extension BINATTS, which extracts a combination of scale independent features utilising both classical moments based measures such as scaled variance, skewness and kurtosis about the major/minor axes and heuristic measures such as hollows, circularity, rectangularity and compactness.

Four ""Corgie"" model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400. This particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, but it would be more difficult to distinguish between the cars.

The images were acquired by a camera looking downwards at the model vehicle from a fixed angle of elevation (34.2 degrees to the horizontal). The vehicles were placed on a diffuse backlit surface (lightbox). The vehicles were painted matte black to minimise highlights. The images were captured using a CRS4000 framestore connected to a vax 750. All images were captured with a spatial resolution of 128x128 pixels quantised to 64 greylevels. These images were thresholded to produce binary vehicle silhouettes, negated (to comply with the processing requirements of BINATTS) and thereafter subjected to shrink-expand-expand-shrink HIPS modules to remove ""salt and pepper"" image noise.

The vehicles were rotated and their angle of orientation was measured using a radial graticule beneath the vehicle. 0 and 180 degrees corresponded to ""head on"" and ""rear"" views respectively while 90 and 270 corresponded to profiles in opposite directions. Two sets of 60 images, each set covering a full 360 degree rotation, were captured for each vehicle. The vehicle was rotated by a fixed angle between images. These datasets are known as e2 and e3 respectively.

 A further two sets of images, e4 and e5, were captured with the camera at elevations of 37.5 degs and 30.8 degs respectively. These sets also contain 60 images per vehicle apart from e4.van which contains only 46 owing to the difficulty of containing the van in the image at some orientations.

The data set contains signals obtained from a variety of different aspect angles, spanning 90 degrees for the cylinder and 180 degrees for the rock.

Each pattern is a set of 60 numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0.  Each number represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time.  The integration aperture for higher frequencies occur later in time, since these frequencies are transmitted later during the chirp.

","The data are MC generated (see below) to simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique. Cherenkov gamma telescope observes high energy gamma rays, taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas, and developing in the atmosphere. This Cherenkov radiation (of visible to UV wavelengths) leaks through the atmosphere and gets recorded in the detector, allowing reconstruction of the shower parameters. The available information consists of pulses left by the incoming Cherenkov photons on the photomultiplier tubes, arranged in a plane, the camera. Depending on the energy of the primary gamma, a total of few hundreds to some 10000 Cherenkov photons get collected, in patterns (called the shower image), allowing to discriminate statistically those caused by primary gammas (signal) from the images of hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere (background).

Typically, the image of a shower after some pre-processing is an elongated cluster. Its long axis is oriented towards the camera center if the shower axis is parallel to the telescope's optical axis, i.e. if the telescope axis is directed towards a point source. A principal component analysis is performed in the camera plane, which results in a correlation axis and defines an ellipse. If the depositions were distributed as a bivariate Gaussian, this would be an equidensity ellipse. The characteristic parameters of this ellipse (often called Hillas parameters) are among the image parameters that can be used for discrimination. The energy depositions are typically asymmetric along the major axis, and this asymmetry can also be used in discrimination. There are, in addition, further discriminating characteristics, like the extent of the cluster in the image plane, or the total sum of depositions.

Each writer contributed with letters (lower and uppercase), digits, and other characters (Spanish diacritics and punctuation marks) that we have not employed in our experiments and are not included in this database version. Two samples have been collected for each pair writer/character, so the total number of samples in this database version is 1364:

          11 writers x 2 repetitions x (2x26 letters + 10 digits)

The proposed task is a writer-independent one consisting of 11 leaving-one-writer-out tests, so the effective training set size (for each one of the 1364 test samples) is 1240:

          10 writers x 2 repetitions x (2x26 letters + 10 digits)
 
Moreover, this classification task is a 35-class one because we have not considered a different class for each different character: each one of the 26 letters is considered as a case-independent class, there are 9 additional clases for non-zero digits, and the zero is included in the same class as o's.

This database is available in a UNIPEN-like format, trying to mimic the original Pendigits database. Two versions of that database are available; see folder: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pen-Based+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits

          One file ""UJIpenchars-w<i>NN</i>"" per writer, where <i>NN</i> = ""01"", ""02""... ""11""

The handwriting samples were collected on a Toshiba Port&eacute;g&eacute; M400 Tablet PC using its cordless stylus. Each one of the 11 writers completed 2 non-consecutive sessions. In each session, the corresponding writer was asked to write one exemplar for each character in a fixed set including lowercase letters, uppercase ones, and digits, along with other characters omitted from this database version. The acquisition program shows a set of boxes on the screen, a different one for each required character, and writers are told to write only inside those boxes.

Only X and Y coordinate information was recorded along the strokes by the acquisition program, without, for instance, pressure level values or timing information. Thus, in multi-stroke samples, no information at all was recorded between strokes; however, in this database version we have included a "".DT 100"" line in sample files after each stroke, following the Pendigits database criterion.

We have observed that runs of consecutive points with identical coordinates were frequently acquired inside strokes; such runs were preserved in this database version, so each database user must decide whether to avoid them by an appropriate preprocessing step or not.",,"  R.

UniversitÃ¤tsstraÃŸe 21-23
91054 Erlangen, Germany","Mammography is the most effective method for breast cancer screening
available today. However, the low positive predictive value of breast
biopsy resulting from mammogram interpretation leads to approximately
70% unnecessary biopsies with benign outcomes. To reduce the high
number of unnecessary breast biopsies, several computer-aided diagnosis
(CAD) systems have been proposed in the last years.These systems
help physicians in their decision to perform a breast biopsy on a suspicious
lesion seen in a mammogram or to perform a short term follow-up
examination instead.
This data set can be used to predict the severity (benign or malignant)
of a mammographic mass lesion from BI-RADS attributes and the patient's age.
It contains a BI-RADS assessment, the patient's age and three BI-RADS attributes
together with the ground truth (the severity field) for 516 benign and
445 malignant masses that have been identified on full field digital mammograms
collected at the Institute of Radiology of the
University Erlangen-Nuremberg between 2003 and 2006.
Each instance has an associated BI-RADS assessment ranging from 1 (definitely benign)
to 5 (highly suggestive of malignancy) assigned in a double-review process by
physicians. Assuming that all cases with BI-RADS assessments greater or equal
a given value (varying from 1 to 5), are malignant and the other cases benign,
sensitivities and associated specificities can be calculated. These can be an
indication of how well a CAD system performs compared to the radiologists.

   Then, several Data Mining methods were applied. After fitting the models, the outputs were
   post-processed with the inverse of the ln(x+1) transform. Four different input setups were
   used. The experiments were conducted using a 10-fold (cross-validation) x 30 runs. Two
   regression metrics were measured: MAD and RMSE. A Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) fed
   with only 4 direct weather conditions (temp, RH, wind and rain) obtained the best MAD value:
   12.71 +- 0.01 (mean and confidence interval within 95% using a t-student distribution). The
   best RMSE was attained by the naive mean predictor. An analysis to the regression error curve
   (REC) shows that the SVM model predicts more examples within a lower admitted error. In effect,
   the SVM model predicts better small fires, which are the majority. ","This dataset is public available for research. The details are described in [Cortez and Morais, 2007].

This data was created by selecting 20 files each from the 10 largest classes 
in the Reuters-21578 collection 
(http://www.daviddlewis.com/resources/testcollections/reuters21578/). 
The files were read out by 3 Indian speakers and an Automatic Speech 
Recognition (ASR) system was used to generate the transcripts. More about the 
ASR system can be found in [1]. Such a dataset will be really helpful to 
study the effect of speech recognition noise on text mining algorithms. 
The first work which refered to this dataset was on noisy text classification[2].

","Each record represents 100 points on a two-dimensional graph. When plotted in order (from 1 through 100) as the Y co-ordinate, the points will create either a Hill (a â€œbumpâ€ in the terrain) or a Valley (a â€œdipâ€ in the terrain).

There are six files, as follows:

(a) Hill_Valley_without_noise_Training.data
(b) Hill_Valley_without_noise_Testing.data

These first two datasets (without noise) are a training/testing set pair where the hills or valleys have a smooth transition.

(c) Hill_Valley_with_noise_Training.data
(d) Hill_Valley_with_noise_Testing.data

These next two datasets (with noise) are a training/testing set pair where the terrain is uneven, and the hill or valley is not as obvious when viewed closely.

","Drugs are typically small organic molecules that achieve their desired activity by binding to a target site on a receptor. The first step in the discovery of a new drug is usually to identify and isolate the receptor to which it should bind, followed by testing many small molecules for their ability to bind to the target site. This leaves researchers with the task of determining what separates the active (binding) compounds from the inactive (non-binding) ones. Such a determination can then be used in the design of new compounds that not only bind, but also have all the other properties required for a drug (solubility, oral absorption, lack of side effects, appropriate duration of action, toxicity, etc.). 
The original data were modified for the purpose of the feature selection challenge. In particular, we added a number of distractor feature called 'probes' having no predictive power. The order of the features and patterns were randomized.

","MADELON is an artificial dataset containing data points grouped in 32 clusters placed on the vertices of a five dimensional hypercube and randomly labeled +1 or -1. The five dimensions constitute 5 informative features. 15 linear combinations of those features were added to form a set of 20 (redundant) informative features. Based on those 20 features one must separate the examples into the 2 classes (corresponding to the +-1 labels). We added a number of distractor feature called 'probes' having no predictive power. The order of the features and patterns were randomized.

","The objective is to determine the set of boolean rules that describe the interactions of the nodes within this plant signaling network. The dataset includes 300 separate boolean pseudodynamic simulations of the true rules, using an asynchronous update scheme. Each of the 300 simulations begin with a randomly generated initial condition, in order to ensure sampling of all of the steady states of the system.  There are a total of 43 nodes in this dataset, with 5 ndoes being constants.

The results for 300 separate simulations are included in the dataset.  Each simulation consists of a matrix of 0's and 1's, with 21 rows and 43 columns.  The first row is the randomly generated initial condition for the particular simulation, with the next 20 rows being the output from the boolean pseudodynamics simulation.  Each of the 43 columns represent the transient response of a particular node.  The nodal names are identified at the top of the data file.  A line of asterisks is used to separate the simulations from one another.  An example set of data is included below:

        December 2008","<font class=""normal"">We have created the UJIpenchars2 character database by collecting samples from 60 writers at two different sites in two phases: <ul><li>1st phase, 11 writers, carried out at UJI.
        <li>2nd phase, 49 writers, carried out at UPV (44 writers) and UJI (5).
</ul>Each writer contributed with letters, digits, and other characters and two samples were collected for each pair writer/character.

The complete lexicon is as follows:<ul><li>66 letters (33 per case): <ul><li>The 52 ASCII letters.
          <li>The 14 Spanish non-ASCII letters:<ul><li>Letter n with tilde (2 characters).
            <li>Vowels with acute accent (10 characters).
            <li>Letter u with diaeresis (2 characters). </ul></ul><li>The 10 digits.
<li>Other 21 characters: <ul><li>The 16 ASCII ones shown in the following line:
            . , ; : ? ! ' ' ( ) % - @ $ < >
          <li>5 non-ASCII ones:<ul> <li>Inverted question and exclamation marks (2 characters).
            <li>Masculine and feminine ordinal indicators (2 characters).
            <li>The euro sign (1 character). </ul></ul></ul>So the total number of samples in this database is 11640:  60 writers x (66+10+21) characters x 2 repetitions

UJIpenchars is a subset of UJIpenchars2 with only 1364 samples: the ASCII letters and digits collected at UJI during the 1st acquisition phase.

We have not defined a standard task for UJIpenchars2, but divided the writer set into two disjoint subsets in order to ease the definition of writer independent tasks:<ul><li>40 'trn' writers: <ul><li>The 11 1st phase UJI writers.
          <li>29 UPV writers.</ul><li>20 'tst' writers: <ul><li>The 5 2nd phase UJI writers.
           <li>15 UPV writers.</ul></ul>The distribution of our database consists of 2 files: <ul><li>This 'uji2.names'.
        <li>The file 'ujipenchars2.txt' containing all the samples in a format described later.</ul>The handwriting samples were collected on a Toshiba PortÃ©gÃ© M400 Tablet PC using its cordless stylus. Each one of the 60 writers completed 2 non-consecutive sessions. In each session, the corresponding writer was asked to write one exemplar for each character in the lexicon. The acquisition program shows a set of boxes on the screen, one for each required character, and writers are told to write only inside those boxes.

Each acquisition box is approximately 13.6 millimetres wide and 20.4 millimetres tall and contais two horizontal guides at approximate distances of 7.5 and 12.7 millimetres from top, respectively.

Writers were instructed to clear the content of the corresponding box by using an on-screen button and try again whenever they made a mistake or were unhappy with the writing of any character. Subjects were monitored only when writing their first exemplars and every sample considered OK by its writer was accepted, even if some of its points lay out of the corresponding acquisition box.

Only X and Y coordinate information was recorded along the strokes by the acquisition program, without, for instance, pressure level values or timing information. Thus, in multi-stroke samples, no information at all was recorded between strokes. Both coordinates were expressed as integer ink units, with the origin lying at the top left corner of the corresponding acquisition box. X values grow left-to-right and Y values grow downwards.

Although we have employed the same acquisition program on identical hardware at UJI and UPV, we have observed that acquisition files seem to show that UPV samples have been collected using acquisition boxes larger than UJI ones. This is due to a different configuration parameter value that, at UPV, makes the acquisition program translate 1 millimetre into 152 ink units, instead of using the standard UJI ratio: 100 ink units per millimetre. If box homogenisation is needed, it can be easily achieved, for instance, by dividing UPV coordinate values by 1.52.

We have also observed that runs of consecutive points with identical coordinates were frequently acquired inside strokes; such runs were preserved in this database, so it is up to its users to decide whether to avoid them by an appropriate preprocessing step or not.

179,SECOM,"Authors: Michael McCann, Adrian Johnston ","A complex modern semi-conductor manufacturing process is normally under consistent surveillance via the monitoring of signals/variables collected from sensors and or process measurement points. However, not all of these signals are equally valuable in a specific monitoring system. The measured signals contain a combination of useful information, irrelevant information as well as noise. It is often the case that useful information is buried in the latter two. Engineers typically have a much larger number of signals than are actually required. If we consider each type of signal as a feature, then feature selection may be applied to identify the most relevant signals. The Process Engineers may then use these signals to determine key factors contributing to yield excursions downstream in the process. This will enable an increase in process throughput, decreased time to learning and reduce the per unit production costs.

To enhance current business improvement techniques the application of feature selection as an intelligent systems technique is being investigated.

The dataset presented in this case represents a selection of such features where each example represents a single production entity with associated measured features and the labels represent a simple pass/fail yield for in house line testing, figure 2, and associated date time stamp. Where â€“1 corresponds to a pass and 1 corresponds to a fail and the data time stamp is for that specific test point.


Using feature selection techniques it is desired to rank features according to their impact on the overall yield for the product, causal relationships may also be considered with a view to identifying the key features.

Results may be submitted in terms of feature relevance for predictability using error rates as our evaluation metrics. It is suggested that cross validation be applied to generate these results. Some baseline results are shown below for basic feature selection techniques using a simple kernel ridge classifier and 10 fold cross validation.

Baseline Results: Pre-processing objects were applied to the dataset simply to standardize the data and remove the constant features and then a number of different feature selection objects selecting 40 highest ranked features were applied with a simple classifier to achieve some initial results. 10 fold cross validation was used and the balanced error rate (*BER) generated as our initial performance metric to help investigate this dataset.

In the video pre-processing, a time normalization is carried out selecting 45 frames from each video, in according 
to an uniform distribution. In each frame, the centroid pixels of the segmented objects (the hand) are found, which 
compose the discrete version of the curve F with 45 points. All curves are normalized in the unitary space.

In order to prepare these movements to be analysed by algorithms, we have carried out a mapping operation, that is, each
curve F is mapped in a representation with 90 features, with representing the coordinates of movement.

183,Communities and Crime,"Creator: Michael Redmond (redmond@lasalle.edu); Computer Science; La Salle University; Philadelphia, PA, 19141, USA
    -- culled from 1990 US Census, 1995 US FBI Uniform Crime Report, 1990 US Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics Survey, available from ICPSR at U of Michigan.
  -- Donor: Michael Redmond (redmond@lasalle.edu); Computer Science; La Salle University; Philadelphia, PA, 19141, USA
  -- Date: July 2009","  Many variables are included so that algorithms that select or learn weights for attributes could be tested. However, clearly unrelated attributes were not included; attributes were picked if there was any plausible connection to crime (N=122), plus the attribute to be predicted (Per Capita Violent Crimes). The variables included in the dataset involve the community, such as the percent of the population considered urban, and the median family income, and involving law enforcement, such as per capita number of police officers, and percent of officers assigned to drug units. 
 
 The per capita violent crimes variable was calculated using population and the sum of crime variables considered violent crimes in the United States: murder, rape, robbery, and assault. There was apparently some controversy in some states concerning the counting of rapes. These resulted in missing values for rape, which resulted in incorrect values for per capita violent crime. These cities are not included in the dataset. Many of these omitted communities were from the midwestern USA.

  Data is described below based on original values. All numeric data was normalized into the decimal range  0.00-1.00 using an Unsupervised, equal-interval binning method. Attributes retain their distribution and skew (hence for example the population attribute has a mean value of  0.06 because most communities are small). E.g. An attribute described as 'mean people per household' is actually the normalized (0-1) version of that value.

  The normalization preserves rough ratios of values WITHIN an attribute (e.g. double the value for double the population within the available precision - except for extreme values (all values more than 3 SD above the mean are normalized to 1.00; all values more than 3 SD below the mean are nromalized to  0.00)).

  However, the normalization does not preserve relationships between values BETWEEN attributes (e.g. it would not be meaningful to compare the value for whitePerCap with the value for blackPerCap for a community)

  A limitation was that the LEMAS survey was of the police departments with at least 100 officers, plus a random sample of smaller departments. For our purposes, communities not found in both census and crime datasets were omitted. Many communities are missing LEMAS data.

","The main idea of this data set is to prepare the algorithm of the expert system, which 
will perform the presumptive diagnosis of two diseases of urinary system. It will be 
the example of diagnosing of the acute inflammations of urinary bladder and acute 
nephritises. For better understanding of the problem let us consider definitions of 
both diseases given by medics. Acute inflammation of urinary bladder is characterised 
by sudden occurrence of pains in the abdomen region and the urination in form of 
constant urine pushing, micturition pains and sometimes lack of urine keeping. 
Temperature of the body is rising, however most often not above 38C. The excreted 
urine is turbid and sometimes bloody. At proper treatment, symptoms decay usually 
within several days. However, there is inclination to returns. At persons with acute 
inflammation of urinary bladder, we should expect that the illness will turn into 
protracted form.

Acute nephritis of renal pelvis origin occurs considerably more often at women than at 
men. It begins with sudden fever, which reaches, and sometimes exceeds 40C. The fever 
is accompanied by shivers and one- or both-side lumbar pains, which are sometimes very 
strong. Symptoms of acute inflammation of urinary bladder appear very often. Quite not 
infrequently there are nausea and vomiting and spread pains of whole abdomen.

The data was created by a medical expert as a data set to test the expert system, which 
will perform the presumptive diagnosis of two diseases of urinary system.  The basis for 
rules detection was Rough Sets Theory.  Each instance represents an potential patient.

The data is in an ASCII file. Attributes are separated by TAB.
Each line of the data file starts with a digit which tells the temperature of patient.

  -- Attribute lines:
       For example, '35,9	no	no	yes	yes	yes	yes	no'
       Where:
	 '35,9'	Temperature of patient 	
	 'no'	Occurrence of nausea 	
	 'no'	Lumbar pain  	
	 'yes'	Urine pushing (continuous need for urination)  	
	 'yes'	Micturition pains  
	 'yes'	Burning of urethra, itch, swelling of urethra outlet 	
	 'yes'	decision: Inflammation of urinary bladder

Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks.  The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.

The original study used a range of linear and nonlinear regression methods to predict the clinician's Parkinson's disease symptom score on the UPDRS scale.","This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 42 people with early-stage Parkinson's disease recruited to a six-month trial of a telemonitoring device for remote symptom progression monitoring. The recordings were automatically captured in the patient's homes.

Columns in the table contain subject number, subject age, subject gender, time interval from baseline recruitment date, motor UPDRS, total UPDRS, and 16 biomedical voice measures. Each row corresponds to one of 5,875 voice recording from these individuals. The main aim of the data is to predict the motor and total UPDRS scores ('motor_UPDRS' and 'total_UPDRS') from the 16 voice measures.

The data is in ASCII CSV format. The rows of the CSV file contain an instance corresponding to one voice recording. There are around 200 recordings per patient, the subject number of the patient is identified in the first column.

Santiago Ontanon (santi@iiia.csic.es)","This dataset contains 503 sponges belonging to the Demospongiae class collected from the Mediterranean (451 sponges) and Atlantic oceans (52 sponges). Each sponge is classified according to a hierarchy formed by: order, family, genus and specie. Each order is subdivided in several families. Each family is also divided in several genus, and each genus in several species:
- There are 7 different orders (between 42 to 117 sponges per order)
- 42 different families (1 to 43 sponges per family)
- 114 different genus (1 to 34 sponges per genus)
- 230 different species (1 to 15 sponges per specie)

Although classification at all these levels can be attempted, it has traditionally been used as a classification dataset, using 'order' as the target class. Moreover, a subset consisting of 280 sponges (orders astrophoricda, axinellida and hadromerida) is also commonly used.

			Guilherme Barreto (guilherme@deti.ufc.br)","The provided files comprise three different data sets. The first one contains the raw values of the measurements 
of all 24 ultrasound sensors and the corresponding class label (see Section 7). Sensor readings are sampled at a 
rate of 9 samples per second.

The second one contains four sensor readings named 'simplified distances' and the corresponding class label (see Section 7). These simplified distances are referred to as the 'front distance', 'left distance', 'right distance' and 'back distance'. They consist, respectively, of the minimum sensor readings among those within 60 degree arcs located at the front, left, right and back parts of the robot.

The third one contains only the front and left simplified distances and the corresponding class label.

It is worth mentioning that the 24 ultrasound readings and the simplified distances were collected at the same time step, so each file has the same number of rows (one for each sampling time step).

The wall-following task and data gathering were designed to test the hypothesis that this apparently simple navigation task is indeed a non-linearly separable classification task. Thus, linear classifiers, such as the Perceptron network, are not able to learn the task and command the robot around the room without collisions. Nonlinear neural classifiers, such as the MLP network, are able to learn the task and command the robot successfully without collisions. 

If some kind of short-term memory mechanism is provided to the neural classifiers, their performances are improved in general. For example, if past inputs are provided together with current sensor readings, even the Perceptron becomes able to learn the task and command the robot succesfully. If a recurrent neural network, such as the Elman network, is used to learn the task, the resulting dynamical classifier is able to learn the task using less hidden neurons than the MLP network.

Files with different number of sensor readings were built in order to evaluate the performance of the classifiers with respect to the number of inputs.",,"Ananda L. Freire, Guilherme A. Barreto, Marcus Veloso and Antonio T. Varela (2009),

To create a model, the following are specified: the number of attributes (up to 1000) and their type (discrete or continuous), the number of classes (up to 10), the complexity of the underlying rules and the noise level. AutoUniv then produces a model through a process of constrained randomised search to satisfy the user's requirements. A model can have up to 3000 rules. Rare class models can be designed. A sequence of models can be designed to reflect concept and/or population drift. 

AutoUniv creates three text files for a model: a Prolog specification of the model used to generate examples (.aupl);  a user-friendly statement of the classification rules in an 'if ... then' format (.aurules);  a statistical summary of the main properties of the model, including its Bayes rate (.auprops).",,"Marrs, G, Hickey, RJ and Black, MM (2010) Modeling the example life-cycle in an online classification learner.

Creator: Marco Cuturi, Kyoto University, mcuturi@i.kyoto-u.ac.jp","We have downloaded 15 months worth of daily data from the California Department of Transportation PEMS website, http://pems.dot.ca.gov, The data describes the occupancy
rate, between 0 and 1, of different car lanes of San Francisco bay area freeways. The measurements cover the period from Jan. 1st 2008 to Mar. 30th 2009 and are sampled every 10 minutes. We consider each day in this database as a single time series of dimension 963 (the number of sensors which functioned consistently throughout the studied period) and length 6 x 24=144. We remove public holidays from the dataset, as well
as two days with anomalies (March 8th 2009 and March 9th 2008) where all sensors were muted between 2:00 and 3:00 AM. This results in a database of 440 time series.

The task we propose on this dataset is to classify each observed day as the correct day of the week, from Monday to Sunday, e.g. label it with an integer in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}. 

I will keep separate copies of this database on my website in a Matlab format. If you use Matlab, it might be more convenient to consider these .mat files directly.

Data-Format
-------------

There are two files for each fold, the data file and the labels file. We have split the 440 time series between train and test folds, but you are of course free to merge them to consider a different cross validation setting.
- The PEMS_train textfile has 263 lines. Each line describes a time-series provided as a matrix. The matrix syntax is that of Matlab, e.g. [ a b ; c d] is the matrix with row vectors [a b] and [c d] in that order. Each matrix describes the different occupancies rates (963 lines, one for each station/detector) sampled every 10 minutes during the day (144 columns).
- The PEMS_trainlabel text describes, for each day of measurements described above, the day of the week on which the data was sampled, namely an integer between 1 (Mon.) and 7 (Sun.).

- PEMS_test and PEMS_testlabels are formatted in the same way, except that there are 173 test instances.

- The permutation that I used to shuffle the dataset is given in the randperm file. If you need to rearrange the data so that it follows the calendar order, you should merge train and test samples and reorder them using the inverse permutation of randperm.",,"M.

","A dataset of online handwritten assamese characters by collecting samples from 45 writers is created. Each writer contributed 52 basic characters, 10 numerals and 121 assamese conjunct consonants. The total number of entries corresponding to each writer is 183 (= 52 characters + 10 numerals + 121 conjunct consonants). The total number of samples in the dataset is 8235 ( = 45 Ãƒâ€” 183 ).

The handwriting samples were collected on an iball 8060U external digitizing tablet connected to a laptop using its cordless digital stylus pen. The data acquisition program consists of a GUI which shows a box on the screen along with other controls. The writers are instructed to write only inside the acquisition box. The acquisition program records the handwriting as a stream of (X, Y) coordinate points using the appropriate pen position sensor along with the pen-up/pen-down switching. No pressure level was recorded. 

The distribution of the dataset consists of 45 folders (one for each writer) and a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Data_Table.pdfÃ¢â‚¬Â file. This file contains information about the character id (ID), character name (Label) and actual shape of the character (Char).  

Each folder contains 183 text files corresponding to the 183 characters written by a single writer. Each file is named based on the pair (M, N). The text file Ã¢â‚¬Å“M.N.txtÃ¢â‚¬Â represents the character with ID Ã¢â‚¬Å“MÃ¢â‚¬Â written by the writer with ID Ã¢â‚¬Å“NÃ¢â‚¬Â.

210,Record Linkage Comparison Patterns,"The underlying records stem from the epidemiological cancer registry of the
German state of North Rhine-Westphalia (Epidemiologisches Krebsregister NRW,
http://www.krebsregister.nrw.de). Creation of comparison patterns and
assignment of matching status were undertaken by staff members of
the Institute for Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (IMBEI)
at the University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, 
Germany (http://www.imbei.uni-mainz.de).","The records represent individual data including first and family name, sex, date of birth and postal code, which were collected through iterative insertions in the course of several years. The comparison patterns in this data set are based on a sample of 100.000 records dating from 2005 to 2008. Data pairs were classified as 'match' or 'non-match' during an extensive manual review where several documentarists were involved. The resulting classification formed the basis for assessing the quality of the 
registryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own record linkage procedure.

In order to limit the amount of patterns, a blocking procedure was applied,
which selects only record pairs that meet specific agreement conditions. The
results of the following six blocking iterations were merged together:

  1. Phonetic equality of first name and family name, equality of date of birth.
  2. Phonetic equality of first name, equality of day of birth.
  3. Phonetic equality of first name, equality of month of birth.
  4. Phonetic equality of first name, equality of year of birth.
  5. Equality of complete date of birth.
  6. Phonetic equality of family name, equality of sex.
  
This procedure resulted in 5.749.132 record pairs, of which 20.931 are matches.

The data set is split into 10 blocks of (approximately) equal size and ratio
of matches to non-matches.

The separate file frequencies.csv contains for every predictive attribute 
the average number of values in the underlying records. These values can, for example,
be used as u-probabilities in weight-based record linkage following the

  -- Donor: Michael Redmond (redmond 'at' lasalle.edu); Computer Science; La Salle University; Philadelphia, PA, 19141, USA","The source datasets needed to be combined via programming. Many variables are included so that algorithms that select or learn weights for attributes could be tested. However, clearly unrelated attributes were not included; attributes were picked if there was any plausible connection to crime (N=125), plus the crime variables which are potential dependent variables. The variables included in the dataset involve the community, such as the percent of the population considered urban, and the median family income, and involving law enforcement, such as per capita number of police officers, and percent of officers assigned to drug units. The crime attributes (N=18) that could be predicted are the 8 crimes considered 'Index Crimes' by the FBI)(Murders, Rape, Robbery, .... ), per capita (actually per 100,000 population) versions of each, and Per Capita Violent Crimes and Per Capita Nonviolent Crimes). 
  
A limitation was that the LEMAS survey was of the police departments with at least 100 officers, plus a random sample of smaller departments. For our purposes, communities not found in both census and crime datasets were omitted. Many communities are missing LEMAS data.

The per capita crimes variables were calculated using population values included in the 1995 FBI data (which differ from the 1990 Census values). 

The per capita violent crimes variable was calculated using population and the sum of crime variables considered violent crimes in the United States: murder, rape, robbery, and assault. There was apparently some controversy in some states concerning the counting of rapes. These resulted in missing values for rape, which resulted in missing values for per capita violent crime. Many of these omitted communities were from the midwestern USA (Minnesota, Illinois, and Michigan have many of these).  
  
The per capita nonviolent crime variable was calculated using the sum of crime variables considered non-violent crimes in the United States: burglaries, larcenies, auto thefts and arsons. (There are many other types of crimes, these only include FBI 'Index Crimes')

Some further pre-processing of the dataset must be done. Choose the desirable dependent variable from among the 18 possible. It would not be interesting or appropriate to predict total crime (e.g. violent crime) while including subtotals (e.g. murders) as independent variables. There are also identifying variables (community name, county code, community code) that are not predictive, and would get in the way of some algorithms. Weka's Unsupervised Attribute Remove Filter can be used to remove unwanted attributes.

The FBI notes that use of this data to evaluate communities is over-simplistic, as many relevant factors are not included. For one example, communities with large numbers of visitors will have higher per capita crime (measured by residents) than communities with fewer visitors, other things being equal.

   Three male and one female subjects (age 25 to 30), who have experienced aggression in scenarios
   such as physical fighting, took part in the experiment. Throughout 20 individual experiments,
   each subject had to perform ten normal and ten aggressive activities. Regarding the rights of the
   subjects involved, ethical regulations and safety precaution have been followed based on the code
   of ethics of the British psychological society. The regulations explain the ethical legislations
   to be applied when experiments with human subjects are conducted. According to the experimental
   setup and the precautions taken, the ultimate risk of injuries was minimal. The subjects were aware

   they could withdraw at any time from the study.

2. Instrumentation:
   The Essex robotic arena was the main experimental hall where the data collection took place.
   With area 4x5.5m, the subjects expressed aggressive physical activities at random locations. A
   professional kick-boxing standing bag has been used, 1.75m tall, with a human figure drawn on
   its body. The subjectsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ performance has been recorded by the Delsys EMG apparatus, interfacing
   human activity with myoelectrical contractions. Based on this context, the data acquisition process
   involved eight skin-surface electrodes placed on the upper arms (biceps and triceps), and upper legs
   (thighs and hamstrings).

3. Data Setup:
   The overall number of electrodes is 8, which corresponds to 8 input time series one for a muscle
   channel (ch1-8). Each time series contains ~10000 samples (~15 actions per experimental session
   for each subject).",,

   Seven male and three female subjects (age 25 to 30), who have experienced aggression in scenarios such
   as physical fighting, took part in the experiment. Throughout 20 individual experiments, each subject
   had to perform ten normal and ten aggressive activities. Regarding the rights of the subjects involved,
   ethical regulations have been followed based on the code of ethics of the British psychological society,
   which explains the ethical legislations to conduct statistical experiments using human subjects. For safety
   precaution issues, boxing hand wraps have been given to the subjects, and for the warm up the subjects
   were instructed to familiarise with the bag by having a number of trial runs. The subjects were aware that
   since their involvement in this series of experiments was voluntary, it was made clear that they could
   withdraw at any time from the study.

2. Instrumentation:
   The Essex robotic arena was the main experimental hall where the data collection took place. With area
   4x5.5m, the ten subjects expressed normal and aggressive physical activities at random locations. For the
   normal actions, a human partner has been used as a focus target attracting the attention from the subjects
   so as to perform more realistic activity. For the aggressive actions, the subjects made use of a professional
   kick-boxing standing bag, 1.75m tall, with a human figure drawn on its body. The bag has cylindrical shape
   made from soft material, which could bounce when hit. All the activities have been recorded from random
   starting positions so that to have a variety of spatial 3D data. The subjectsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ performance has been recorded
   by the ViconÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nine ubiquitous cameras, interfacing human activity with spatial coordinate points. Based on
   this context, the data acquisition process involved four reflectable markers placed on the forearms (elbows
   and wrists), four on the forelegs (knees and ankles), and one on the top of the head.

3. Data Setup:
   Each experimental trial has been taken separately for each physical activity. The duration of each action
   was approximately ~10 seconds per subject, which corresponds to a time series of ~3000 samples, with
   sampling frequency of 200Hz. Within this performance time, approximately 15 action trajectories were
   extracted counting in average 15 normal (ex: handshaking), and 15 aggressive (ex: punching) actions.",,"1. T. Theodoridis and H. Hu, Classifying Aggressive Actions of 3D Human Models Using

In this experiment, a pair of videos were shown to the user and the user was asked to vote for the video that they found funnier. Left/right positions of the videos were randomly selected before being presented to the user to eliminate position bias. Videos were selected from a large pool of weekly updated sets of videos.

One of the outcomes of this experiment is a training dataset for automatically predicting which video would be deemed funnier by users using a variety of features.  For example, uploader supplied metadata and/or user comments on watch pages of these videos could be used as features. See http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2012/02/quantifying-comedy-on-youtube-why.html for more detail. The attached dataset includes roughly 1.7 million preference votes. The votes were recorded chronologically. The first 80% are provided here as the training dataset and the remaining 20% as the testing dataset. Each line in this dataset corresponds to one vote over a pair of YouTube videos. Each video is represented by its YouTube video ID. For example, the watch page URL for video ID 'txqiwrbYGrs' is http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txqiwrbYGrs. User preference over a pair of videos is presented in the form of string Ã¢â‚¬Å“leftÃ¢â‚¬Â if the left video was deemed funnier, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“rightÃ¢â‚¬Â otherwise. This user vote should be used as ground truth for both training and testing. Evaluation should be based on average accuracy in predicting this preference over the testing partition (provided).

","This archive contains 13910 measurements from 16 chemical sensors utilized in simulations for drift compensation in a discrimination task of 6 gases at various levels of concentrations. The goal is to achieve good performance (or as low degradation as possible) over time, as reported in the paper mentioned below in Section 2: Data collection. The primary purpose of providing this dataset is to make it freely accessible on-line to the chemo-sensor research community and artificial intelligence to develop strategies to cope with sensor/concept drift. The dataset can be used exclusively for research purposes. Commercial purposes are fully excluded.
The dataset was gathered within January 2007 to February 2011 (36 months) in a gas delivery platform facility situated at the ChemoSignals Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego. Being completely operated by a fully computerized environment Ã¢â‚¬â€controlled by a LabVIEWÃ¢â‚¬â€œNational Instruments software on a PC fitted with the appropriate serial data acquisition boards. The measurement system platform provides versatility for obtaining the desired concentrations of the chemical substances of interest with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner, minimizing thereby the common mistakes caused by human intervention and making it possible to exclusively concentrate on the chemical sensors for compensating real drift.
The resulting dataset comprises recordings from six distinct pure gaseous substances, namely Ammonia, Acetaldehyde, Acetone, Ethylene, Ethanol, and Toluene, each dosed at a wide variety of concentration values ranging from 5 to 1000 ppmv. See Tables 1 and 2 of the below cited manuscript for details on the gas identity name, concentration values, and time distribution sequence of the measurement recordings considered in this dataset.

A subset of this dataset was used for the ""OPPORTUNITY Activity Recognition Challenge"" organized for the 2011 IEEE conf on Systems, Man and Cybernetics Workshop on ""Robust machine learning techniques for human activity recognition"". 

The dataset comprises the readings of motion sensors recorded while users executed typical daily activities:
  * Body-worn sensors: 7 inertial measurement units, 12 3D acceleration sensors, 4 3D localization information
  * Object sensors: 12 objects with 3D acceleration and 2D rate of turn
  * Ambient sensors: 13 switches and 8 3D acceleration sensors
  * Recordings: 4 users, 6 runs per users. Of these, 5 are Activity of Daily Living runs characterized by a natural execution of daily activities. The 6th run is a ""drill"" run, where users execute a scripted sequence of activities. 
  * Annotations/classes: the activities of the user in the scenario are annotated on different levels: ""modes of locomotion"" classes; low-level actions relating 13 actions to 23 objects; 17 mid-level gesture classes; and 5 high-level activity classes

** Recording scenario **

The activity recognition environment and scenario has been designed to generate many activity primitives, yet in a realistic manner. Subjects operated in a room simulating a studio flat with a deckchair, a kitchen, doors giving access to the outside, a coffee machine, a table and a chair.

We achieved a natural execution of activities by instructing users to follow a high-level script but leaving them free interpretation as how to achieve the high-level goals. We furthermore encouraged them to perform as naturally as possible with all the variations they were used to.

For each subject we recorded 6 different runs. Five of them, termed activity of daily living (ADL), followed a given scenario as detailed below. The remaining one, a drill run, was designed to generate a large number of activity instances. The ADL run consists of temporally unfolding situations. In each situation (e.g. preparing sandwich), a large number of action primitives occur (e.g. reach for bread, move to bread cutter, operate bread cutter).

* ADL run *

The ADL run consists of temporally unfolding situations:

    Start: lying on the deckchair, get up
    Groom: move in the room, check that all the objects are in the right places in the drawers and on shelves
    Relax: go outside and have a walk around the building
    Prepare coffee: prepare a coffee with milk and sugar using the coffee machine
    Drink coffee: take coffee sips, move around in the environment
    Prepare sandwich: include bread, cheese and salami, using the bread cutter and various knifes and plates
    Eat sandwich
    Cleanup: put objects used to original place or dish washer, cleanup the table
    Break: lie on the deckchair

* Drill run *

The drill run consists of 20 repetitions of the following sequence of activities:

    Open then close the fridge
    Open then close the dishwasher
    Open then close 3 drawers (at different heights)
    Open then close door 1
    Open then close door 2
    Toggle the lights on then off
    Clean the table
    Drink while standing
    Drink while seated

** Annotations **

The annotations are done on five Ã‚â€˜tracksÃ‚â€™. One track contains modes of locomotion (e.g. sitting, standing, walking). Two other tracks indicate the actions of the left and right hand (e.g. reach, grasp, release), and to which object they apply (e.g. milk, switch, door).
The fourth track indicates the high level activities (e.g. prepare sandwich). The high level activities relate to the situations indicated in the description of the ADL runs as follows (in parenthesis the number of the situations indicated above): relaxing (1, 9), early morning (2, 3), coffee time (4, 5), sandwich time (6, 7), cleanup (8).

The mid-level gesture annotations is generated automatically from the low-level hand actions. It comprises coarser characterization of the user's activities. For instance the low-level annotations 'reach door' and 'open door' are combined into a single 'open door' mid-level annotation. Here, the mid-level annotations comprise actions of the left and right hand indiscriminately. However, in practice, the users mostly interacted with the environment with their right hand. We recommend to use the mid-level annotations in first attempts to use this dataset.

** Applications **

This dataset offers a rich playground to assess methods such as, e.g:

  * Classification, (semi-) supervised machine learning
  * Automatic segmentation
  * Unsupervised structure discovery
  * Data imputation
  * Multi-modal sensor fusion
  * Sensor network research
  * Transfer learning, multitask learning
  * Sensor selection
  * Feature extraction
  * Classifier calibration and adaptation
  * ...

-> A collection of 425 SMS spam messages was manually extracted from the Grumbletext Web site. This is a UK forum in which cell phone users make public claims about SMS spam messages, most of them without reporting the very spam message received. The identification of the text of spam messages in the claims is a very hard and time-consuming task, and it involved carefully scanning hundreds of web pages. The Grumbletext Web site is: http://www.grumbletext.co.uk/.
-> A subset of 3,375 SMS randomly chosen ham messages of the NUS SMS Corpus (NSC), which is a dataset of about 10,000 legitimate messages collected for research at the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. The messages largely originate from Singaporeans and mostly from students attending the University. These messages were collected from volunteers who were made aware that their contributions were going to be made publicly available.

230,Planning Relax,"Rajen Bhatt, rajen.bhatt@gmail.com, IIT Delhi","EEG record contains many regular oscillations, which are believed to reflect synchronized rhythmic activity in a group of neurons. Most activity related EEG patterns occur within the following frequency bands. Delta (0.5 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4 Hz.), Theta (4 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8 Hz), Alpha (8 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 13 Hz), Beta (13 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 22 Hz), and Gamma (30 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 40 Hz). The waves with the frequency of  7 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 13 Hz over motor processing areas are called mu rhythm and reflect idling activity in motor areas. It is more pronounced when the subjects are at rest and at least a second before subjects initiate voluntary movement, the mu  activity over the hemisphere contralateral to the region moved shows a decrease in amplitude and is called Event Related Desynchronization (ERD).
For the current study, EEG data was collected for 5 times on various days from a healthy right-handed subject of 25 years of age. The data was recorded on a Medelec Profile Digital EEG machine. The settings of high frequency filter 50 Hz, low frequency filter 1.6 Hz, notch filter 50 Hz, sensitivity 70 micro volts/mm, and a sampling rate of 256 Hz were used for the basic signal processing.
 Eight EEG electrodes (C3, C4, P3, P4, F3, F4, T3, and T4) were placed according to the international standard 10-20 system of electrode placement. Bipolar and unipolar EEG was recorded from eight Ag/AgCI scalp electrodes, which were placed 2.5 cm anterior and posterior to the central electrodes C3 and C4 (left and right side of the hemisphere). A1 and A2 are reference electrodes. The reference electrodes are placed on the left and right ears and the ground electrode on the forehead. EOG (Electrooculogram) being a noise artifact, was derived from two electrodes, placed on the outer cantus of left and right eye in order to detect eye movement. These EOG signals are then used to eliminate eye movement artifacts. 
The subject was asked to lie down comfortably in a relaxed position with eyes closed and advised to minimize eye movements. The EEG was recorded for the relaxed state for 5 minutes. Following this, an audio beep of 60 db and 0.91 sec. duration was given at the start and end of a 5 second epoch where the subject was asked to mentally plan lifting of the right hand thumb. This activity is collected as a 5 second epoch data corresponding to Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmovement imageryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ state. After a gap of 5 minutes, the same cue is given to repeat the experiment. The whole experiment lasts for approximately 30 minutes, collecting data for 5 trials of 5 second epoch each for normal relaxed state and 5 trials of 5 second epoch each for movement imagery. No actual movement is performed during the session. All data sets were visually checked for artifacts before final selection.","Rajen Bhatt, 'Planning-Relax Dataset for Automatic Classification of EEG Signals', UCI Machine Learning Repository","1.

The schema matching was done manually. The ideal entities matching are grouped into classes. In total, there are 115 input database entities stored respectively as '.dat' from the first database and as '.txt' if from the second database. The file naming pattern is attributeName@ColumnName@Database. After schema matching, the files are grouped into 34 classes (folders). 33 classes are ideal matchings whereas the class 'UNCLASSED' groups all the attributes that are unique and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have another similar attribute.

Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

The Daphnet Freezing of Gait Dataset is a dataset devised to benchmark automatic methods to recognize gait freeze from wearable acceleration sensors placed on legs and hip.

The dataset was recorded in the lab with emphasis on generating many freeze events. Users performed there kinds of tasks: straight line walking, walking with numerous turns, and finally a more realistic activity of daily living (ADL) task, where users went into different rooms while fetching coffee, opening doors, etc.

This dataset is the result of a collaboration between the Laboratory for Gait and Neurodynamics, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Israel and the Wearable Computing Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland. Recordings were run at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center in 2008. The study was approved by the local Human Subjects Review Committee, and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.

18000 times-series measurements recorded from a 72 metal-oxide gas sensor array-based chemical detection platform.

Number of attributes (features):
Every measurement contains 72 time-series recorded during 260 seconds, each collected at a sample rate of 100 Hz (samples per second).
The dataset also contains time, temperature, and relative humidity information.
The resulting dataset ultimately includes 75-time series composed of 26000 points.


This archive contains 18000 time-series measurement recordings collected from an array of 72 metal-oxide gas sensors composing our sensing platform utilized in the detection and identification of potentially-dangerous chemical gaseous substances under complex environmental conditions, as reported in the related manuscript below. Our primary purpose is to make our dataset freely accessible on-line to the chemo-sensing research and machine-learning communities, as well as other interested communities, to develop alternative competitive solutions relevant to gas-sensing discrimination tasks in open sampling settings, such as the one pursued here, and/or navigation. The dataset can be used exclusively for research purposes. Commercial purposes are fully excluded.
The dataset was gathered from December 2010 to April 2012 (16 months) in a 2.5 m Ãƒâ€” 1.2 m Ãƒâ€” 0.4 m wind tunnel research test-bed facility situated at the BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego. Specifically, our customized research facility, endowed with a computer-supervised mass flow controller-based continuous flow gas delivery system, operates in a propulsion open-cycle mode, by continuously drawing external turbulent air into and throughout the tunnel and exhausting it back to the outside, thereby creating a relatively less-turbulent airflow moving downstream towards the end of the test field, which is particularly suitable for applications pursued here that require injecting chemical poisonous agents or explosive mixtures because it prevents saturation. Being operated by a fully computerized environment Ã¢â‚¬â€controlled by a player/stage robot server software programmed on C++ on a PC fitted with the appropriate serial cardsÃ¢â‚¬â€ and with minimum human intervention, the designed wind tunnel test-bed facility provides versatility for releasing the chemical substances of interest at the desired concentrations with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner during the entire experiment and simultaneously in preserving the appropriate environmental conditions to generate chemical gas plumes exhibiting turbulent patterns. A graphical illustration of the designed wind tunnel test-bed facility considered in this study along with the characteristics of the geometry of the problem as well as the exact locations of the chemical analyte source and chemo-sensory platform is presented in Figure 2 of the manuscript cited below. Actual pictures of the designed wind tunnel are also presented in the Supplementary Material, Figure S.1 of the accompanying manuscript.
The resulting dataset induces a ten-class gas discrimination problem, comprising recordings from ten distinct pure chemical gases, namely Acetone, Acetaldehyde, Ammonia, Butanol, Ethylene, Methane, Methanol, Carbon Monoxide, Benzene, and Toluene. The goal is to identify and discriminate the mentioned chemical hazards at relevant concentrations regardless of the location of the sensory system platform within the annotated wind tunnel research facility as well as the environmental and parametric conditions induced in the setting (Please see manuscript for more details). See Table 1 on Vergara et a. 2013 (manuscript below) for specifics on the identity of chemical analyte hazards as well as their nominal concentration values at the outlet of the gas source in parts-per-million by volume (ppmv). Please refer to the manuscript below for a more details of the wind tunnel test-bed facility as well as for specifics on the collection procedure followed and the operating and environmental parameters utilized during the creation of the aforementioned dataset.

Each species was represented by 11 to 60 mass spectra obtained from 7 to 20 bacterial strains, constituting altogether a dataset of 571 spectra obtained from 213 strains. The spectra were obtained according to the standard culture-based workflow used in clinical routine in which the microorganism was first grown on an agar plate for 24 to 48 hours, before a portion of colony was picked, spotted on a MALDI slide and a mass spectrum was acquired. 
B) Based on this reference panel, a dedicated in vitro mock-up mixture dataset was constituted. For that purpose we considered 10 pairs of species of various taxonomic proximity:
   * 4 mixtures, labelled A, B, C and D, involved species that belong to the same genus,
   * 2 mixtures, labelled E and F, involved species that belong to distinct genera, but to the same Gram type,
   * 4 mixtures, labelled G, H, I and J, involved species that belong to distinct Gram types.
Each mixture was represented by 2 pairs of strains, which were mixed according to the following 9 concentration ratios : 1:0, 10:1, 5:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, 0:1. Two replicate spectra were acquired for each concentration ratio and each couple of strains, leading altogether to a dataset of 360 spectra, among which 80 are actually pure sample spectra.","If you have no special citation requests, please leave this field blank.","MahÃ© et al.

","Brief Description of the Dataset:
---------------------------------
Each of the 19 activities is performed by eight subjects (4 female, 4 male, between the ages 20 and 30) for 5 minutes.
Total signal duration is 5 minutes for each activity of each subject.
The subjects are asked to perform the activities in their own style and were not restricted on how the activities should be performed. For this reason, there are inter-subject variations in the speeds and amplitudes of some activities. 
The activities are performed at the Bilkent University Sports Hall, in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering Building, 
and in a flat outdoor area on campus. Sensor units are calibrated to acquire data at 25 Hz sampling frequency. The 5-min signals are divided into 5-sec segments so that 480(=60x8) signal segments are obtained for each activity.

The 19 activities are: 
sitting (A1), 
standing (A2), 
lying on back and on right side (A3 and A4), 
ascending and descending stairs (A5 and A6), 
standing in an elevator still (A7) 
and moving around in an elevator (A8), 
walking in a parking lot (A9), 
walking on a treadmill with a speed of 4 km/h (in flat and 15 deg inclined positions) (A1
0 and A11),
running on a treadmill with a speed of 8 km/h (A12), 
exercising on a stepper (A13), 
exercising on a cross trainer (A14), 
cycling on an exercise bike in horizontal and vertical positions (A15 and A16),
rowing (A17), 
jumping (A18), 
and playing basketball (A19).

File structure:

19 activities (a) (in the order given above)
 8 subjects   (p)
60 segments   (s)
 5 units on torso (T), right arm (RA), left arm (LA), right leg (RL), left leg (LL)
 9 sensors on each unit (x,y,z accelerometers, x,y,z gyroscopes, x,y,z magnetometers)
 
Folders a01, a02, ..., a19 contain data recorded from the 19 activities.

For each activity, the subfolders p1, p2, ..., p8 contain data from each of the 8 subjects.

In each subfolder, there are 60 text files s01, s02, ..., s60, one for each segment.

In each text file, there are 5 units x 9 sensors = 45 columns and 5 sec x 25 Hz = 125 rows.
Each column contains the 125 samples of data acquired from one of the sensors of one of the units over a period of 5 sec.
Each row contains data acquired from all of the 45 sensor axes at a particular sampling instant separated by commas.

Columns 1-45 correspond to:  
 T_xacc,  T_yacc,  T_zacc,  T_xgyro, ...,  T_ymag,  T_zmag,
RA_xacc, RA_yacc, RA_zacc, RA_xgyro, ..., RA_ymag, RA_zmag,
LA_xacc, LA_yacc, LA_zacc, LA_xgyro, ..., LA_ymag, LA_zmag,
RL_xacc, RL_yacc, RL_zacc, RL_xgyro, ..., RL_ymag, RL_zmag,
LL_xacc, LL_yacc, LL_zacc, LL_xgyro, ..., LL_ymag, LL_zmag.

Therefore,
columns  1-9  correspond to the sensors in unit 1 (T), 
columns 10-18 correspond to the sensors in unit 2 (RA), 
columns 19-27 correspond to the sensors in unit 3 (LA), 
columns 28-36 correspond to the sensors in unit 4 (RL), 
columns 37-45 correspond to the sensors in unit 5 (LL).

mining hazards. A special case of such threat is a seismic hazard which frequently occurs in many 
underground mines. Seismic hazard is the hardest detectable and predictable of natural hazards and in 
this respect it is comparable to an earthquake. More and more advanced seismic and seismoacoustic 
monitoring systems allow a better understanding rock mass processes and definition of seismic hazard 
prediction methods. Accuracy of so far created methods is however far from perfect. Complexity of 
seismic processes and big disproportion between the number of low-energy seismic events and the number 
of high-energy phenomena (e.g. > 10^4J) causes the statistical techniques to be insufficient to predict 
seismic hazard. Therefore, it is essential to search for new opportunities of better hazard prediction, 
also using machine learning methods. In seismic hazard assessment data clustering techniques can be 
applied (Lesniak A., Isakow Z.: Space-time clustering of seismic events and hazard assessment in the 
Zabrze-Bielszowice coal mine, Poland. Int. Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences, 46(5), 2009, 
918-928), and for prediction of seismic tremors artificial neural networks are used (Kabiesz, J.: Effect 
of the form of data on the quality of mine tremors hazard forecasting using neural networks. 
Geotechnical and Geological Engineering, 24(5), 2005, 1131-1147). In the majority of applications, the 
results obtained by mentioned methods are reported in the form of two states which are interpreted as 
'hazardous' and 'non-hazardous'. Unbalanced distribution of positive ('hazardous state') and negative 
('non-hazardous state') examples is a serious problem in seismic hazard prediction. Currently used 
methods are still insufficient to achieve good sensitivity and specificity of predictions. In the paper 
(Bukowska M.: The probability of rockburst occurrence in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin area dependent on 
natural mining conditions. Journal of Mining Sciences, 42(6), 2006, 570-577) a number of factors having 
an effect on seismic hazard occurrence was proposed, among other factors, the occurrence of tremors with 
energy > 10^4J was listed. The task of seismic prediction can be defined in different ways, but the main 
aim of all seismic hazard assessment methods is to predict (with given precision relating to time and 
date) of increased seismic activity which can cause a rockburst. In the data set each row contains a 
summary statement about seismic activity in the rock mass within one shift (8 hours). If decision 
attribute has the value 1, then in the next shift any seismic bump with an energy higher than 10^4 J was 
registered. That task of hazards prediction bases on the relationship between the energy of recorded 
tremors and seismoacoustic activity with the possibility of rockburst occurrence. Hence, such hazard 
prognosis is not connected with accurate rockburst prediction. Moreover, with the information about the 
possibility of hazardous situation occurrence, an appropriate supervision service can reduce a risk of 
rockburst (e.g. by distressing shooting) or withdraw workers from the threatened area. Good prediction 
of increased seismic activity is therefore a matter of great practical importance.   The presented data 
set is characterized by unbalanced distribution of positive and negative examples. In the data set there 
are only 170 positive examples representing class 1.

The measurement system platform provides versatility for obtaining the desired concentrations of the chemical substances of interest with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner, minimizing thereby the common mistakes caused by human intervention and making it possible to exclusively concentrate on the chemical sensors. See reference 1 for more details on the experimental setup. 

The resulting dataset comprises recordings from six distinct pure gaseous substances, namely Ammonia, Acetaldehyde, Acetone, Ethylene, Ethanol, and Toluene, dosed at a wide variety of concentration levels in the intervals (50,1000), (5,500), (12,1000), (10,300), (10,600), and (10,100) ppmv, respectively.","Citation of both papers is required:

Holiday Schedule: http://dchr.dc.gov/page/holiday-schedule","Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues. 

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.","Fanaee-T, Hadi, and Gama, Joao, 'Event labeling combining ensemble detectors and background knowledge', Progress in Artificial Intelligence (2013): pp. 1-15, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, doi:10.1007/s13748-013-0040-3.

A combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. While the Vacuum is colected from and has effect on the Steam Turbine, he other three of the ambient variables effect the GT performance.

of mankind. Prehistoric men created the desired shape of a stone tool
by striking on a raw stone, thus splitting off flakes, the waste
products of the crafting process. Archaelogists do not find many tools,
but they do find flakes. The data set is about these flakes. Its rows do
not stand for single flakes but for whole inventories of them. The given
features are relative frequencies of binary, and mean values of numerical
characteristics taken over all pieces found in the inventory. A question
related to the data set is: Does the data reflect the technological
progress during several hundred thousand years?

Annotation:
The columns below stand for the identifier of the inventory, a group
defined by the archaeologists mainly by age and hominid type (1=Lower
Paleolithic, Homo ergaster?, oldest; 2=Levallois technique; 3=Middle
Paleolithic, probably Neanderthals; 4=Homo sapiens, youngest), age of
the stone artefacts (millennia, not to be taken too seriously), mode of
dating (geological=more accurate, typological), stone material (1=flint,
2=other), region (mit=Central Germany, d=Non-Central Germany, eur=Europe
without Germany), site (1=gravel pit, 0=other), number of finds in
inventory.

","The PD database consists of training and test files. The training data belongs to 20 PWP (6 female, 14 male) and 20 healthy individuals (10 female, 10 male) who appealed at the Department of Neurology in Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University. From all subjects, multiple types of sound recordings (26 voice samples including sustained vowels, numbers, words and short sentences) are taken.  A group of 26 linear and timeÃ¢â‚¬â€œfrequency based features are extracted from each voice sample. UPDRS ((Unified ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Disease Rating Scale) score of each patient which is determined by expert physician is also available in this dataset. Therefore, this dataset can also be used for regression.

After collecting the training dataset which consists of multiple types of sound recordings and performing our experiments, in line with the obtained findings we continued collecting an independent test set from PWP via the same physicianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s examination process under the same conditions. During the collection of this dataset, 28 PD patients are asked to say only the sustained vowels 'a' and 'o' three times respectively which makes a total of 168 recordings. The same 26 features are extracted from voice samples of this dataset. This dataset can be used as an independent test set to validate the results obtained on training set.

of the blog posts were crawled and processed. 
The prediction task associated with the data is the prediction 
of the number of comments in the upcoming 24 hours. In order 
to simulate this situation, we choose a basetime (in the past) 
and select the blog posts that were published at most
72 hours before the selected base date/time. Then, we calculate
all the features of the selected blog posts from the information 
that was available at the basetime, therefore each instance 
corresponds to a blog post. The target is the number of 
comments that the blog post received in the next 24 hours 
relative to the basetime. 

In the train data, the basetimes were in the years 
2010 and 2011. In the test data the basetimes were 
in February and March 2012. This simulates the real-world 
situtation in which training data from the past is available 
to predict events in the future.

The train data was generated from different basetimes that may 
temporally overlap. Therefore, if you simply split the train 
into disjoint partitions, the underlying time intervals may 
overlap. Therefore, the you should use the provided, temporally 
disjoint train and test splits in order to ensure that the

","The REALDISP (REAListic sensor DISPlacement) dataset has been originally collected to investigate the effects of sensor displacement in the activity recognition process in real-world settings. It builds on the concept of ideal-placement, self-placement and induced-displacement. The ideal and mutual-displacement conditions represent extreme displacement variants and thus could represent boundary conditions for recognition algorithms. In contrast, self-placement reflects a users perception of how sensors could be attached, e.g., in a sports or lifestyle application. The dataset includes a wide range of physical activities (warm up, cool down and fitness exercises), sensor modalities (acceleration, rate of turn, magnetic field and quaternions) and participants (17 subjects). Apart from investigating sensor displacement, the dataset lend itself for benchmarking activity recognition techniques in ideal conditions.

SENSOR SETUP:
Each sensor provides 3D acceleration (accX,accY,accZ), 3D gyro (gyrX,gyrY,gyrZ), 3D magnetic field orientation (magX,magY,magZ) and 4D quaternions (Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4). The sensors are identified according to the body part on which is placed respectively:

S1: left calf (LC)
S2: left thigh (LT)
S3: right calf (RC)
S4: right thigh (RT)
S5: back (BACK)
S6: left lower arm (LLA)
S7: left upper arm (LUA)
S8: right lower arm (RLA)
S9: right upper arm (RUA)

SCENARIOS:
The dataset contains information for three different scenarios depending on whether the sensors are positioned on predefined positions or placed by the users themselves.
- Ideal-placement or the default scenario. The sensors are positioned by the instructor on predefined locations within each body part. The data stemming from this scenario could be considered as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“training setÃ¢â‚¬Â for supervised activity recognition systems.
- Self-placement. The user is asked to position a subset of the sensors themselves on the body parts specified by the instructor, but without providing any hint on how the sensors must be exactly placed. This scenario is devised to investigate some of the variability that may occur in the day-to-day usage of an activity recognition system, involving wearable or self-attached sensors. Normally, the self-placement will lead to on-body sensor setups that differ from the ideal-placement. Nevertheless, this difference may be minimal if the subject places the sensor close to the ideal position.
- Induced-displacement. An intentional mispositioning of sensors using rotations and translations with respect to the ideal placement is introduced by the instructor. One of the key interests of including this last scenario is to investigate how the performance of a certain method degrades as the system drifts far from the ideal setup.

A complete and illustrated description (including table of activities, sensor setup, etc.) of the dataset is provided in the documentation facilitated along with the dataset. Also, the papers presented in the section Ã¢â‚¬Å“Citation RequestsÃ¢â‚¬Â provide an insightful description of the dataset and the underlying theory.

","The measured data was collected using a chemical sensing system based on an array of 16 metal-oxide gas sensors and an external mechanical ventilator to simulate the biological respiration cycle. The tested gas classes (12 in total) formed a relatively broad combination of two analytes, acetone and ethanol, in binary mixtures. Both, raw data set and feature data set, are available. In particular, two sets of low-frequency and high-frequency features are provided for a comparison study.

The primary data analysis is supposed to be a multivariate regression with multiple responses (two responses), where the predictors were the features extracted from the sensor signals and the responses were the concentrations of two analytes, acetone and ethanol. This task is also known as a mixture quantification problem of two analytes. Please see the article (Ziyatdinov et al., 2014, Section 3.2) for such regression analysis based on partial least squares (PLS). A classification task is also possible given that a small number of samples per class is available, if all the 12 classes are used. Another classification problem can be stated to distinguish two pure analytes and mixtures of them.

Three concentrations doses 0.1, 0.3 and 1 vol.% were used to prepare the dilutions in water for the pure analytes. The same dilutions were used to generate gas mixtures. The gas classes included samples of pure ethanol ('lab' attribute eth-0.1, eth-0.3 and eth-1), samples of pure acetone (ace-0.1, ace-0.3 and ace-1), samples of binary mixtures of ethanol and acetone (ace-0.1-eth-0.1, ace-0.1-eth-0.3, ace-0.3-eth-0.1, ace-0.1-eth-1 and ace-1-eth-0.1) and samples of water dilutions without any analyte (air) giving a total number of 12 classes. The choice of these analytes and concentrations was not affected by any particular application constraint, except that the sensors of selected models show consistent and diverse responses among the gas classes. The statistics on class distribution among 58 samples:

eth-0.1: 6
eth-0.3: 4
eth-1: 5
ace-0.1: 6
ace-0.3: 6
ace-1: 3
ace-0.1-eth-0.1: 4
ace-0.1-eth-0.3: 5
ace-0.3-eth-0.1: 5
ace-0.1-eth-1: 3
ace-1-eth-0.1: 3
air: 8

The measurements were split into 5 batches ('batch' attribute), where each batch contained records approximately for all gas classes given in a random order. All the batches were collected in a time period of 4 days to minimize the effect of the long-term internal and environmental noise in the system. The statistics on batch distribution among 58 samples:

day-1-morning: 19
day-2-afternoon: 10
day-2-morning: 10
day-3-morning: 11
day-4-afternoon: 8

The array was composed of 16 metal-oxide gas sensors of 5 different TGS models from Figaro Inc. The sensors were configured for 10 different sensor conditioning profiles based on the combination of 5 TGS models and 2 sensor operating temperatures. The circuit board with the gas sensor array was placed in a 70 ml inner volume chamber connected to the mechanical ventilator. The device of the mechanical ventilator was made commercially available from Harvard Apparatus (Harvard Apparatus, Harvard Inspira Advanced Safety Ventilator Manual, Tech. rep., 2003). The mechanical ventilator includes a cylinder of volume 63.44 cm3 and a mechanical pump that takes air from the outlet 'Source' and pushes the air sample through the outlet 'To Animal'. The system also receives the sample again in the outlet 'From Animal' to close the loop, control the air pressure decay, and collect the exhaled air. The cylinder of the ventilator was fixed to a frequency of 5 breaths per minute, approximately equivalent to 0.08 Hz for all the measurements. See the article (Ziyatdinov et al., 2014, Section 2.1) for a detailed description of the experimental set up.

The measurement protocol was the following: using a micropipette we delivered 10 ÃŽÂ¼l of the corresponding dilution to the vessel, which in turn was connected to the apparatus 'Source' channel to expose the sensor array to the generated gas sample. After 3 min of exposition, the source of the gas vapour was removed from the vessel to start the recovery phase. During the recovery phase, the system was sampling room air for 2 additional minutes to record the decay in the sensors signals. The recorded time-series signal for each sensor was acquired at the sampling frequency of 25 Hz during 5 min, resulting in 7500 data points per time-series of a single sensor. Note that 2 minutes of recovery phase was not sufficient to recover the sensors baseline and re-establish again the initial conditions in the gas chamber. Hence, although we acquired 2 minutes of recovery phase, the system was pumping air until the sensors recovered the baseline and the whole gas sample was exhausted from the gas chamber.

The readout data was the output voltage of the sensor stored as resistance values according to the voltage-divider scheme and using the value of the load resistor. Hence, each data point in the array described the resistance of a sensor R(t) at a certain time of measurement t. The resistance
values in the data set were normalized by subtracting the baseline value R0 = R(t0) at the
starting point of the measurement t0 and scaling by factor R0, (R(t) Ã¢Ë†â€™ R0)/R0. Note that such format of the measured raw data allows for comparison of responses among different sensors.

Previously to computing the low-frequency and high-frequency features, the raw data were pre-processed by a set of digital filters. A median filter was used to remove the spikes in the signals. Then we employed two Butterworth filters of 3rd order: a low-pass filter (cut-off frequency 0.01 Hz) and a high-pass filter (pass-frequency 0.07 Hz) to generate the low/high frequency signals, respectively. Note that these low/high frequency signals (output of the two Butterworth filters) are not distributed within the data set.

For feature extraction, both low-frequency and high-frequency sensor signals were divided by respiratory cycles, where each cycle was processed independently. Thus, a feature is referred to as a feature by respiratory cycle. Since high-frequency signals showed oscillatory behavior similar to a sine wave curve, we decided to follow a straightforward strategy for feature extraction in this case. We used amplitude of the high-frequency signal (oscillation) at every respiratory cycle as a feature. Low-frequency trajectories had a monotonic behaviour, and we used the magnitude of the low-frequency signal as a feature at every respiratory cycle. The magnitude value was taken at the same time of oscillation, where the amplitude of the high-frequency signal was measured. Note that the low-frequency and high-frequency features were computed only for the first 13 respiration cycles.

In addition to the low/high frequency features, we also introduced a cycle-independent feature per
single measurement, defined as the maximum of the low-frequency signal over the course of
the measurement.

The first data analysis of the data set was presented in (Ziyatdinov et al., 2014), and the results reported there should be considered as a reference. The study aimed to characterize and explore the sensor signals in response to the modulated gas flow at a fixed respiration frequency. It was expected to confirm a superior performance of the proposed system under the gas flow modulation on the early detection scenario. The acquired modulated signals were decomposed into low-frequency and high-frequency components, and the resulted feature sets were compared in terms of the discrimination performance. Note that it was assumed that the low-frequency part of the modulated signals approximate the signals that would be measured under the standard constant flow rate mode (such assumption was empirically confirmed by observing the transient dynamics).

The strategy in signal- and data-processing applied in (Ziyatdinov et al., 2014) was straightforward, and the analysis can be improved in a number of ways, on the stages of feature extraction and/or pattern recognition. Hence, the raw data stored in 'rawdata.csv.gz' file is intended for testing feature extraction methods, while the features computed in (Ziyatdinov et al., 2014) and stored in 'features.csv' can be readily used in testing pattern recognition methods.

The experimental setup was designed to test gas sensors in realistic environments. Traditionally, chemical detection systems based on chemo-resistive sensors include a gas chamber to control the sample air flow and minimize turbulence. Instead, we utilized a wind tunnel with two independent gas sources that generate two gas plumes. The plumes get naturally mixed along a turbulent flow and reproduce the gas concentration fluctuations observed in natural environments. Hence, the gas sensors can capture the spatio-temporal information contained in the gas plumes.

a) Chemical detection platform:
The chemical detection platform was composed of 8 MOX gas sensors that generate a time-dependent multivariate response to the different gas stimuli. The utilized sensors were made commercially available by Figaro (TGS2611, TGS2612, TGS2610, TGS2600, TGS2602 TGS2620). The operating temperature of the sensors was controlled by the built-in heater, which was kept at a constant voltage of 5V. The detection platform also includes Temperature and Relative Humidity sensors. The generated sensors' responses were acquired at a sampling rate of 20 ms for the whole duration of the experiment.

b) Wind tunnel:
In order to generate two independent gas plumes in an open environment, we built a 2.5 m x 1.2 m x 0.4 m wind tunnel facility with two gas sources (labeled as source1 and source2). Each source was controlled independently to release the selected volatiles at different flow rates, which generated different concentration levels in the sensors' position. The wind generator created a turbulent flow that constantly displaced the introduced volatiles towards the exhaust outlet.

c) Experimental protocol:
We exposed the detection unit to mixtures of Ethylene with Methane or Carbon Monoxide. The mixtures were originated releasing Ethylene at source1 and releasing Methane / Carbon Monoxide at source2.

Each volatile was released at four different flows (zero z, low l, medium m, and high h), providing up to 30 different mixture configurations: 15 mixtures of Ethylene with CO (h+h, h+m, h+l, Ã¢â‚¬Â¦, z+h, z+m, z+l) and 15 mixtures of Ethylene with Methane. Each configuration was repeated 6 times. Hence, the complete dataset was composed of 180 measurements, which were performed in a random order. 

By means of a GCMS system, the mean concentration levels at the sensors' location were estimated: Ethylene (l: 31 ppm, m: 46 ppm, h: 96 ppm), CO (l: 270 ppm, m: 397 ppm, h: 460 ppm), Methane (l: 51 ppm, m: 115 ppm, h: 131 ppm). It is worth noting that GC-MS systems only provide the mean value of the concentration and are not sensitive to concentration fluctuations.

Each measurement, which had a total duration of 300 seconds, was performed as follows: Initially no gas was released and clean air flowed along the wind tunnel. 60 seconds after, both sources started to release the corresponding volatile at the specified flow rate. The duration of the gas release was 180 s. Finally, the system acquired the recovery to the baseline for another 60 s. ","The following citation is requested if you use the dataset:

Therefore, automatic user localization has been a hot research topic in the last years. Automatic user localization consists of estimating the position of the user (latitude, longitude and altitude) by using an electronic device, usually a mobile phone. Outdoor localization problem can be solved very accurately thanks to the inclusion of GPS sensors into the mobile devices. However, indoor localization is still an open problem mainly due to the loss of GPS signal in indoor environments. Although, there are some indoor positioning technologies and methodologies, this database is focused on WLAN fingerprint-based ones (also know as WiFi Fingerprinting).

Although there are many papers in the literature trying to solve the indoor localization problem using a WLAN fingerprint-based method, there still exists one important drawback in this field which is the lack of a common database for comparison purposes. So, UJIIndoorLoc database is presented to overcome this gap. We expect that the proposed database will become the reference database to compare different indoor localization methodologies based on WiFi fingerprinting.

The UJIIndoorLoc database covers three buildings of Universitat Jaume I with 4 or more floors and almost 110.000m2. It can be used for classification, e.g. actual building and floor identification, or regression, e.g. actual longitude and latitude estimation. It was created in 2013 by means of more than 20 different users and 25 Android devices. The database consists of 19937 training/reference records (trainingData.csv file) and 1111 validation/test records (validationData.csv file).

The 529 attributes contain the WiFi fingerprint, the coordinates where it was taken, and other useful information.

Each WiFi fingerprint can be characterized by the detected Wireless Access Points (WAPs) and the corresponding Received Signal Strength Intensity (RSSI). The intensity values are represented as negative integer values ranging -104dBm (extremely poor signal) to 0dbM. The positive value 100 is used to denote when a WAP was not detected. During the database creation, 520 different WAPs were detected. Thus, the WiFi fingerprint is composed by 520 intensity values.

Then the coordinates (latitude, longitude, floor) and Building ID are provided as the attributes to be predicted. 

Additional information has been provided.

The particular space (offices, labs, etc.) and the relative position (inside/outside the space) where the capture was taken have been recorded. Outside means that the capture was taken in front of the door of the space.

Information about who (user), how (android device & version) and when (timestamp) WiFi capture was taken is also recorded.

For example, assume you collect data daily.  When Monday is over you have all of the data for that day.  However you can invest on Monday, because you don't get the data until the end of the day.  You can use the data from Monday to invest on Tuesday.  

In our research each record (row) is data for a week.  Each record also has the percentage of return that stock has in the following week (percent_change_next_weeks_price). Ideally, you want to determine which stock will produce the greatest rate of return in the following week.  This can help you train and test your algorithm.

Some of these attributes might not be use used in your research.  They were originally added to our database to perform calculations.  (Brown, Pelosi & Dirska, 2013) used percent_change_price, percent_change_volume_over_last_wk, days_to_next_dividend, and percent_return_next_dividend.  We left the other attributes in the dataset	in case you wanted to use any of them. Of course what you want to maximize is percent_change_next_weeks_price.

Training data vs Test data:
In (Brown, Pelosi & Dirska, 2013) we used quarter 1 (Jan-Mar) data for training and quarter 2 (Apr-Jun) data for testing. 

Interesting data points:
If you use quarter 2 data for testing, you will notice something interesting in the week ending 5/27/2011 every Dow Jones Index stock lost money.","We request that you provide a citation to this paper when using the dataset.  We welcome you to

The data were collected at a sampling rate of 500 Hz, using as a programming kernel the National InstrumentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (NI) Labview. The signals were band-pass filtered using a Butterworth Band Pass filter with low and high cutoff at 15Hz and 500Hz respectively and a notch filter at 50Hz to eliminate line interference artifacts.
The hardware that was used was an NI analog/digital conversion card NI USB- 009, mounted on a PC. The signal was taken from two Differential EMG Sensors and the signals were transmitted to a 2-channel EMG system by Delsys BagnoliÃ¢â€žÂ¢ Handheld EMG Systems.

Protocol: 
The experiments consisted of freely and repeatedly grasping of different items, which were essential to conduct the hand movements. The speed and force were intentionally left to the subjectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s will. There were two forearm surface EMG electrodes Flexor Capri Ulnaris and Extensor Capri Radialis, Longus and Brevis) held in place by elastic bands and the reference electrode in the middle, in order to gather information about the muscle activation.

The subjects were asked to perform repeatedly the following six movements, which can be considered as daily hand grasps:
a) Spherical: for holding spherical tools
b) Tip: for holding small tools 
c) Palmar: for grasping with palm facing the object
d) Lateral: for holding thin, flat objects
e) Cylindrical: for holding cylindrical tools
f) Hook: for supporting a heavy load

An illustrative photo is included in the data folder.

Two different databases are included:
1) 5 healthy subjects (two males and three females) of the same age approximately (20 to 22-year-old) conducted the six grasps for 30 times each. The measured time is 6 sec. There is a mat file available for every subject. 
2) 1 healthy subject (male, 22-year-old) conducted the six grasps for 100 times each for 3 consecutive days. The measured time is 5 sec. There is a mat file available for every day.","If you found useful these databases, please cite the following:

The music used is traditional, ethnic or `world' only, as classified by the publishers of the product on which it appears. Any Western music is not included because its influence is global - what we seek are the aspects of music that most influence location. Thus, being able to specify a location with strong influence on the music is central. 

The geographical location of origin was manually collected the information from the CD sleeve notes, and when this information was inadequate we searched other information sources. The location data is limited in precision to the country of origin.  

The country of origin was determined by the artist's or artists' main country/area of residence.  Any track that had ambiguous origin is not included.  We have taken the position of each country's capital city (or the province of the area) by latitude and longitude as the absolute point of origin.

The program MARSYAS[1] was used to extract audio features from the wave files. We used the default MARSYAS settings in single vector format (68 features) to estimate the performance with basic timbal information covering the entire length of each track. No feature weighting or pre-filtering was applied. All features were transformed to have a mean of 0, and a standard deviation of 1. We also investigated the utility of adding chromatic attributes. These describe the notes of the scale being used. This is especially important as a distinguishing feature in geographical ethnomusicology. The chromatic features provided by MARSYAS are 12 per octave - Western tuning, but it may be possible to tell something from how similar to or different from Western tuning the music is.

The different blocks forming the complete simulator (Propeller, Hull, GT, Gear Box and Controller) have been developed and fine tuned over the year on several similar real propulsion plants. In view of these observations the available data are in agreement with a possible real vessel.
In this release of the simulator it is also possible to take into account the performance decay over time of the GT components such as GT compressor and turbines.
The propulsion system behaviour has been described with this parameters:
- Ship speed (linear function of the lever position lp).
- Compressor degradation coefficient kMc.
- Turbine degradation coefficient kMt.
so that each possible degradation state can be described by a combination of this triple (lp,kMt,kMc).
The range of decay of compressor and turbine has been sampled with an uniform grid of precision 0.001 so to have a good granularity of representation.
In particular for the compressor decay state discretization the kMc coefficient has been investigated in the domain [1; 0.95], and the turbine coefficient in the domain [1; 0.975].
Ship speed has been investigated sampling the range of feasible speed from 3 knots to 27 knots with a granularity of representation equal to tree knots.
A series of measures (16 features) which indirectly represents of the state of the system subject to performance decay has been acquired and stored in the dataset over the parameter's space.

Special importance is attached to facial expressions in the area of sign language, since they help to form the grammatical structure of the language and allow for the creation of language disambiguation, and thus are called Grammatical Facial Expressions. This dataset was already used in the experiments described in Freitas et al. (2014).

   The dataset is composed by eighteen videos recorded using Microsoft Kinect sensor. In each video, a user performs (five times), in front of the sensor, five sentences in Libras (Brazilian Sign Language) that require the use of a grammatical facial expression. By using Microsoft Kinect, we have obtained: (a) a image of each frame, identified by a timestamp; (b) a text file containing one hundred coordinates (x, y, z) of points from eyes, nose, eyebrows, face contour and iris; each line in the file corresponds to points extracted from one frame. The images enabled a manual labeling of each file by a specialist, providing a ground truth for classification.

   The dataset is organized in 36 files: 18 datapoint files and 18 target files, one pair for each video which compose the dataset.The name of the file refers to each video: the letter corresponding to the user (A and B), name of grammatical facial expression and a specification (target or datapoints).

Sensors placed on the subject's chest, right wrist and left ankle are used to measure the motion experienced by diverse body parts, namely, acceleration, rate of turn and magnetic field orientation. The sensor positioned on the chest also provides 2-lead ECG measurements, which can be potentially used for basic heart monitoring, checking for various arrhythmias or looking at the effects of exercise on the ECG.

DATASET SUMMARY:
#Activities: 12 
#Sensor devices: 3
#Subjects: 10
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
The collected dataset comprises body motion and vital signs recordings for ten volunteers of diverse profile while performing 12 physical activities (Table 1). Shimmer2 [BUR10] wearable sensors were used for the recordings. The sensors were respectively placed on the subject's chest, right wrist and left ankle and attached by using elastic straps (as shown in the figure in attachment). The use of multiple sensors permits us to measure the motion experienced by diverse body parts, namely, the acceleration, the rate of turn and the magnetic field orientation, thus better capturing the body dynamics. The sensor positioned on the chest also provides 2-lead ECG measurements which are not used for the development of the recognition model but rather collected for future work purposes. This information can be used, for example, for basic heart monitoring, checking for various arrhythmias or looking at the effects of exercise on the ECG. All sensing modalities are recorded at a sampling rate of 50 Hz, which is considered sufficient for capturing human activity. Each session was recorded using a video camera. This dataset is found to generalize to common activities of the daily living, given the diversity of body parts involved in each one (e.g., frontal elevation of arms vs. knees bending), the intensity of the actions (e.g., cycling vs. sitting and relaxing) and their execution speed or dynamicity (e.g., running vs. standing still). The activities were collected in an out-of-lab environment with no constraints on the way these must be executed, with the exception that the subject should try their best when executing them.

ACTIVITY SET
The activity set is listed in the following:
L1: Standing still (1 min) 
L2: Sitting and relaxing (1 min) 
L3: Lying down (1 min) 
L4: Walking (1 min) 
L5: Climbing stairs (1 min) 
L6: Waist bends forward (20x) 
L7: Frontal elevation of arms (20x)
L8: Knees bending (crouching) (20x)
L9: Cycling (1 min)
L10: Jogging (1 min)
L11: Running (1 min)
L12: Jump front & back (20x)
NOTE: In brackets are the number of repetitions (Nx) or the duration of the exercises (min).

","This data set contains the acquired time series from 16 chemical sensors exposed to gas mixtures at varying concentration levels. In particular, we generated two gas mixtures: Ethylene and Methane in air, and Ethylene and CO in air. Each measurement was constructed by the continuous acquisition of the 16-sensor array signals for a duration of about 12 hours without interruption. 

The data set was collected in a gas delivery platform facility at the ChemoSignals Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego. The measurement system platform provides versatility for obtaining the desired concentrations of the chemical substances of interest with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner. 

The sensor array included 16 chemical sensors (Figaro Inc., US) of 4 different types: TGS-2600, TGS-2602, TGS-2610, TGS-2620 (4 units of each type). The sensors were integrated with customized signal conditioning and control electronics. The operating voltage of the sensors, which controls the sensorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ operating temperature, was kept constant at 5 V for the whole duration of the experiments. The sensorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ conductivities were acquired continuously at a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. The sensor array was placed in a 60 ml measurement chamber, where the gas sample was injected at a constant flow of 300 ml/min.

Each measurement was constructed by the continuous acquisition of the 16-sensor array signals while concentration levels changed randomly. For each measurement (each gas mixture), the signals were acquired continuously for about 12 hours without interruption. 

The concentration transitions were set at random times (in the interval 80-120s) and to random concentration levels. The data set was constructed such that all possible transitions are present: increasing, decreasing, or setting to zero the concentration of one volatile while the concentration of the other volatile is kept constant (either at a fixed or at zero concentration level). At the beginning, ending, and approximately every 10,000 s, we inserted additional predefined concentration patterns with pure gas mixtures.

The concentration ranges for Ethylene, Methane, and CO were selected such that the induced magnitudes of the sensor responses were similar. Moreover, for gas mixtures, lower concentration levels were favored. Therefore, the multivariate response of the sensors to the presented set of stimuli is challenging since none of the configurations (single
gas or mixture presentation) can be easily identified from the magnitude of sensorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ responses. In particular Ethylene concentration ranges from 0-20 ppm; 0-600 ppm for CO; and 0-300 ppm for Methane.

The primary purpose of making this data set freely accessible on-line is to provide extensive and continuous time series acquired from chemical sensors to the sensor and artificial intelligence research communities to develop and test strategies to solve a wide variety of tasks. In particular, the data set may be useful to develop algorithms for continuous monitoring or improve response time of sensory systems. Also, the repetition of the same type of sensors in the array will allow further investigation on sensor variability (reproducibility of sensors of the same kind). Other interesting topics may include sensor failure (to what extent system predictions degrade when sensors start failing) or calibration transfer (whether the model for one sensor can be extended to other sensors).

rdkannao@gmail.com , prithwijit.guha@gmail.com ","Automatic identification of commercial blocks in news videos finds a lot of applications in the domain of television broadcast analysis and monitoring. Commercials occupy almost 40-60%  of total air time. Manual segmentation of commercials from thousands of TV news channels is time consuming, and economically infeasible hence prompts the need for machine learning based Method. Classifying TV News commercials is a semantic video classification problem. TV News commercials on particular news channel are combinations of video shots uniquely characterized by audio-visual presentation. Hence various audio visual features extracted from video shots are widely used for TV commercial classification.  Indian News channels do not follow any particular news presentation format, have large variability and  dynamic nature presenting a challenging machine learning problem.  Features from 150 Hours of broadcast news videos from 5 different ( 3 Indian and  2 International News channels)  news channels. Viz. CNNIBN, NDTV 24X7, TIMESNOW, BBC and CNN are presented in this dataset.  Videos are recorded at resolution of 720 X 576 at 25 fps  using a DVR and set top box. 3 Indian channels are recorded concurrently while 2 International are recorded together.

The work was performed under the auspices of the US Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344, and is released under UCRL number LLNL-MISC-668913. 
","This data set contains time series of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations at 2921 grid cells in California created using simulations of the Weather Research and Forecast model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). Each grid cell covers an area of 12 km by 12 km, and there is one data file per grid cell. Each file contains 16 time series of GHG concentrations. The data points in the time series are spaced 6 hours apart (4 samples per day) over the period May 10 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ July 31, 2010. The first 15 rows are time series of GHG tracers released from 14 distinct spatial regions in California and one outside of California. The last row corresponds to the time series of Ã¢â‚¬Å“synthetic GHG observationsÃ¢â‚¬Â generated with EDGAR emissions of HFC-134a scaled by a factor 0.7 and with noise added.

Using this data, the goals are to (1) use inverse methods to determine the optimal values of the weights in the weighted sum of 15 tracers that best matches the synthetic observations, (2) and use optimization methods to determine the best locations to observe GHGs to constrain the inversion. We used a Bayesian method for (1) and genetic algorithms for (2).

   (c) Indication of study's results.  Significant predictions in multiple portfolios.  See publications.
4. Relevant Information Paragraph:
   The files were zipped (on a Windows machine) by year.
   The data here are the ZZAlphaÃ‚Â® machine learning recommendations made for various US traded stock portfolios the morning of each day during the 3 year period Jan 1, 2012 - Dec 31, 2014.  They are deposited here in .txt form for easy accessibility (and as a convenience to users, have had results included for each recommendation).  
A .pdf version of the original recommendations file was certified by Digistamp (.p7s) at time of creation each day for stringent auditability.  Please contact info@zzalpha.com if you desire to purchase the set of the certified .pdf, .p7s file pairs.  The certified set contains only the recommendations, not the results included in the deposited set here.
For convenience, the data deposited includes calculated returns (outcomes) for each recommended transaction.  The returns obviously were not part of the original recommendations when made, but were appended later.  Returns were calculated several days after sale day.
The date inside the file reflects the date for which morning trading recommendation was made.  The evaluation of the recommendations, as described in the KDD 2015 article mentioned above, involved comparison of the opening price of the day of recommendation to the opening price five market days later.  As mentioned in the article, evaluation must be adjusted by trading costs and constraints.
A recommendation portfolio consists of a segment, a size (1,2,5,10,20), and a side (Long or Short),  and the ticker symbols of the companies recommended for price increase (or decrease in the case of Short) from the opening price to the opening price 5 trading days later.
The stocks included must first pass a general screen of $3 recent price and 80,000 recent daily average share volume for inclusion.  Thus penny stocks and micro-caps are not present and even some large cap, but very low prices stocks are omitted.  All stocks must be traded on NYSE, NASDAQ or AMEX at the time of recommendation.
The daily file contains all recommendations for all portfolios for the day.  Both long and short recommendations are included. Long entries have duplicates.

These are the portfolios:  (Note other portfolios limited to ETFs (exchange traded funds) may be listed each day.  Due to data issues those are incomplete across the time period.)
 

5. Number of Instances: 755 market days, 41 portfolios, 5 sizes of portfolios, Long and Short
6. Number of Attributes 
   The data set submitted does not include attributes used for prediction. This data is provided as a benchmark of machine learning results in a longitudinal 3 yr period. 

Here is a sample content of a line in the files:

Jan 04 2005_006 Big_100_5_LONG_SHORT_F.pdf, L, AA 0.959 =25.97/27.09, AMAT 0.950 =14.70/15.46, EBAY 0.930 =53.33/57.31, PFE 0.995 =19.84/19.95, UPS 0.980 =71.72/73.16, Avg of 5 = 0.963

The above indicates recommendations were made before market open on Jan 4, 2005.  This portfolio was limited to the biggest 100 cap stocks and was of size 5.  It was for 'L' or long recommendations.  The five stocks recommended are shown by ticker, result, price at sale divided by price at purchase.  The average for the five is shown.


Note: The user of this data set must implement its own parser of these files.  The contributor does NOT provide one.
Note: The prices used are adjusted prices based on data when results were calculated.  Back-calculation of the adjusted prices using newer data may give different prices, but the ratios will remain the same (+/- rounding errors).

7. For Each Attribute: Not applicable
8. Missing Attribute Values: On some days for a few portfolios, results may be missing.  These are tagged as 'missing'.
9. Class Distribution: Distribution of positive and negative outcomes vary by portfolio, size, and day.

www.smartlab.ws","The experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. They performed a protocol of activities composed of six basic activities: three static postures (standing, sitting, lying) and three dynamic activities (walking, walking downstairs and walking upstairs). The experiment also included postural transitions that occurred between the static postures. These are: stand-to-sit, sit-to-stand, sit-to-lie, lie-to-sit, stand-to-lie, and lie-to-stand. All the participants were wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist during the experiment execution. We captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz using the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope of the device. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of 561 features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

This dataset is an updated version of the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using smartphones Dataset that can be found at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
This version provides the original raw inertial signals from the smartphone sensors, instead of the ones pre-processed into windows which were provided in version 1. This change was done in order to be able to make online tests with the raw data. Moreover, the activity labels were updated in order to include postural transitions that were not part of the previous version of the dataset.

","The data set consists of the expression levels of 77 proteins/protein modifications that produced detectable signals in the nuclear fraction of cortex. There are 38 control mice and 34 trisomic mice (Down syndrome), for a total of 72 mice. In the experiments, 15 measurements were registered of each protein per sample/mouse. Therefore, for control mice, there are 38x15, or 570 measurements, and for trisomic mice, there are 34x15, or 510 measurements. The dataset contains a total of 1080 measurements per protein. Each measurement can be considered as an independent sample/mouse.

The eight classes of mice are described based on features such as genotype, behavior and treatment. According to genotype, mice can be control or trisomic. According to behavior, some mice have been stimulated to learn (context-shock) and others have not (shock-context) and in order to assess the effect of the drug memantine in recovering the ability to learn in trisomic mice, some mice have been injected with the drug and others have not.

Classes:
c-CS-s: control mice, stimulated to learn, injected with saline (9 mice)
c-CS-m: control mice, stimulated to learn, injected with memantine (10 mice)
c-SC-s: control mice, not stimulated to learn, injected with saline (9 mice)

However, it is still very difficult for the mobile sensing community to compare state-of-art Indoor Positioning Systems due to the scarcity of publicly available databases. Magnetic field-based methods are becoming an important trend in this research field. Here, we present UJIIndoorLoc-Mag database, which can be used to compare magnetic field-based indoor localization methods. It consists of 270 continuous samples for training and 11 for testing. Each sample comprises a set of discrete captures taken along a corridor (or an intersection) with a period of 0.1 seconds. In total, there are almost 40.000 discrete captures, where each one contains features obtained from the magnetometer, the accelerometer and the orientation sensor of the device.

Data has been stored as a simple text file as follows: 

ts_1	mx_1	my_1	mz_1	ax_1	ay_1	az_1	ox_1	oy_1	oz_1
Ã¢â‚¬Â¦									
ts_n	mx_n	my_n	mz_n	ax_n	ay_n	az_n	ox_n	oy_n	oz_n
<m>									
lat_1	lon_1	lat_2	lon_2	FS_1	LS_1				
Ã¢â‚¬Â¦									
lat_m	lon_m	lat_m+1	lon_m+1	FS_m	LS_m				

Where n is the number of samples collected in the trajectory at a 0.1 seconds frequency and m is the number of segments (corridors) in the trajectory. Each sample contains the timestamp ts and the values from magnetometer, accelerometer and orientation sensors in the three axes, which are denoted with mx, my, mz, ax, ay, az, ox, oy and oz. Finally, lat_i and lon_i corresponds to the coordinates (latitude & longitude in decimal degrees) of the initial, intermediate (intersections) and final points. A trajectory with m corridors has m+1 points. FS_i and LS_i state for the i-th trajectoryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first and last sample respectively in the full sequence of samples collected during the trajectory mapping. 

According to the previous structure, the text files are composed by two well-differentiated parts separated by the row indicating the number of segments in the trajectory: 1) the sequence of discrete samples taken during the trajectory mapping, and 2) the configuration data. 

The first part contains the timestamp (the UNIX time format in milliseconds) and the vector data from magnetometer (AndroidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD), accelerometer (TYPE_LINEAR_ACCELERATION) and orientation (TYPE_ORIENTATION) sensors. The accelerometerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s values do not include the gravity force to have a better representation of userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s real movement. 

The second part contains the information about location of initial, intermediate and ending points Moreover, the samples can be associated to corridor segments and, moreover, information about turnings is also provided in all the samples.

The database consists of 281 continuous samples, 270 are for training and 11 for testing. They have been stored as independent text files. The training ones are grouped into two main categories Ã¢â‚¬Å“linesÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“curvesÃ¢â‚¬Â. 
- The Ã¢â‚¬Å“linesÃ¢â‚¬Â group has 80 files and they stand for the single corridor case. The format for filename is Ã¢â‚¬Å“lXX_ZZ.txtÃ¢â‚¬Â where XX stands for the number of corridor & orientation (n or r) and ZZ stands for repetition. Example: l3r_03.txt
- The Ã¢â‚¬Å“curvesÃ¢â‚¬Â group has 190 files and they stand for all possible trajectories considering two connected corridors only. The format for that groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s filename is Ã¢â‚¬Å“cXXYY_ZZ.txtÃ¢â‚¬Â where XX and YY stand for the number of corridor & orientation for the first and second corridors in the two corridors trajectory, and ZZ stands for repetition. Example: c5n1r_05.txt
- The testing filesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ filename format is Ã¢â‚¬Å“ttPP.txtÃ¢â‚¬Â where PP stands for the complex testing trajectory number. Example: tt03.txt

Paolo Barsocchi: paolo.barsocchi '@' isti.cnr.it
Claudio Gallicchio: gallicch '@' di.unipi.it","This dataset represents a real-life benchmark in the area of Ambient Assisted Living applications, as described in [1].
The binary classification task consists in predicting  the pattern of user movements in real-world office environments from time-series generated by a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). 
Input data contains temporal streams of radio signal strength (RSS) measured between the nodes of a WSN, comprising 5 sensors: 4 anchors deployed in the environment and 1 mote worn by the user. Data has been collected during user movements at the frequency of 8 Hz (8 samples per second). In the provided dataset, the RSS signals have been rescaled to the interval [-1,1], singly on the set of traces collected from each anchor (as in [1]).
Target data consists in a class label indicating whether the user's trajectory will lead to a change in the spatial context (i.e. a room change) or not. In particular, the target class +1 is associated to the location changing movements, while the target class -1 is associated to the location preserving movements.
The measurement campaign involved a number of 3 different environmental settings, each of which comprises 2 rooms (containing typical office furniture) separated by a corridor. A sketch of the common setup considered is provided in the attached Figure. In each environmental setting, the anchors are deployed in fixed positions near the rooms corners (at the height of 1.5 m from the ground), while the mobile is worn on the chest of the user. The Figure also shows a simplified illustration of the types of user trajectories considered, with straight paths yielding to a spatial context change and curved ones leading to spatial context preservation. Each path produces a trace of RSS measurements from the beginning of the trajectory until a marker point, which is denoted as M in the Figure. The marker M is the same for all the movements, therefore different paths cannot be distinguished based only on the RSS values collected at M.

Each input file in the provided dataset contains data pertaining to one temporal sequence of input RSS data (1 user trajectory for each file). The dataset contains 314 sequences, for a total number of 13197 steps.

","This research aimed at the case of customersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ default payments in Taiwan and compares the predictive accuracy of probability of default among six data mining methods. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. Because the real probability of default is unknown, this study presented the novel Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sorting Smoothing MethodÃ¢â‚¬Â to estimate the real probability of default. With the real probability of default as the response variable (Y), and the predictive probability of default as the independent variable (X), the simple linear regression result (Y = A + BX) shows that the forecasting model produced by artificial neural network has the highest coefficient of determination; its regression intercept (A) is close to zero, and regression coefficient (B) to one. Therefore, among the six data mining techniques, artificial neural network is the only one that can accurately estimate the real probability of default.","Yeh, I. C., & Lien, C. H. (2009).

","The PD and control handwriting database consists of 25 PWP (People with parkinson) and 15 healthy individuals who appealed at the Department of Neurology in Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University. From all subjects, three types of handwriting recordings (Static Spiral Test (SST), Dynamic Spiral Test (DST) and Stability Test on Certain Point (STCP)) are taken. Also the drawings of spirals belongs to the PWP are included in the dataset as image. Therefore, this dataset can also be used for regression.

Handwriting  dataset  was  constructed  using  Wacom  Cintiq  12WX  graphics  (Hahne  et  al.,  2009) table. It  is  basically  a  graphics  tablet  and  LCD  monitor  rolled  into  one.  It  enables  to  display  a  PC's  screen  on  its  monitor  and  only  interacts  with  digitized  pens. Special software was designed for recording handwriting drawings and testing the coordination of the PD patients using the recordings. The software uses API functions of the device and was developed in C# platform which can be run on Windows systems You can contact with the authors to request the software which is mentioned [1].

In this study, there are three different kinds of tests developed for the data collection via graphics tablet. The first one isthe  Static  Spiral  Test  (SST)  which  is  frequently  used  for  clinical  research  in  the  literature  for  different  purposes  like  determining motor performance (Wang et al., 2008), measuring tremor (Pullman, 1998) and diagnosing PD (Saunders et al., 2008). In this test, three wound Archimedean spirals appears on the graphics tablet using the software and patients were asked to retrace the same spiral as much as they can using the digital pen. During the test, the features which are mentioned above and the other data to specify the patient are recorded to the database. 

The second test is the Dynamic Spiral Test (DST). Unlike SST, Archimedean spiral just appears and disappears in certain time intervals, in other words the Archimedean spiral blinks. This forces the patient to keep the pattern in mind and continue to draw. The purpose of this test is to determine the change in patient's drawing performance and pause times since it is more difficult to retrace the Archimedean spiral in this case. As a result of this test, it is observed that most of the patients continued drawing but nearly all of them lost the pattern.

The third test is Stability Test on Certain Point (STCP). In this test, there is a certain red point in the middle of the screen and the subjects are asked to hold the digital pen on the point without touching the screen in a certain time. The purpose of this test is to determine the patient's hand stability or hand tremor level.

","This dataset has recordings of a gas sensor array composed of 8 MOX gas sensors, and a temperature and humidity sensor. This sensor array was exposed to background home activity while subject to two different stimuli: wine and banana. The responses to banana and wine stimuli were recorded by placing the stimulus close to the sensors. The duration of each stimulation varied from 7min to 2h, with an average duration of 42min. This dataset contains a set of time series from three different conditions: wine, banana and background activity. There are 36 inductions with wine, 33 with banana and 31 recordings of background activity. One possible application is to discriminate among background, wine and banana.

This dataset is composed of two files: HT_sensor_dataset.dat (zipped), where the actual time series are stored, and the HT_Sensor_metadata.dat, where metadata for each induction is stored. Each induction is uniquely identified by an id in both files. Thus, metadata for a particular induction can be easily found by matching columns id from each file. 

We also made available python scripts to exemplify how to import, organize and plot our data. The scripts are available on GitHub:
https://github.com/thmosqueiro/ENose-Decorr_Humdt_Temp

For each induction, we include one hour of background activity prior to and after the stimulus presentation. Time series were recorded at one sample per second, with minor variations at some data points due to issues in the wireless communication. For details on which sensors were used and how the time series is organized, see Attribute Information below.

The metadata stored in file HT_Sensor_metadata.dat is divided in the following columns:

* id: identification of the induction, to be matched with id in file HT_Sensor_dataset.dat;
* date: day, month and year when this induction was recorded;
* class: what was used to generate this induction (wine, banana or background);
* t0: time in hours in which the induction started (represents the time zero in file HT_Sensor_dataset.dat);
* dt: interval that this induction lasted.

uploaded to these social networking services is increasing day by day. So,
there is massive requirement to study the highly dynamic behavior of users
towards these services. This is a preliminary work to model the user
patterns and to study the effectiveness of machine learning predictive
modeling approaches on leading social networking service Facebook. We
modeled the user comment patters, over the posts on Facebook Pages and
predicted that how many comments a post is expected to receive in next H
hrs. In order to automate the process, we developed a software prototype
consisting of the crawler, Information extractor, information processor and
knowledge discovery module. We used Neural Networks and Decision Trees,
predictive modeling techniques on different dataset variants and evaluated
them under Hits(at)10 (custom measure), Area Under Curve, Evaluation Time
and Mean Absolute error evaluation metrics. We concluded that the Decision
trees performed better than the Neural Networks under light of all
evaluation metrics.'

(b) Department of Computer Science, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy","This dataset represents a real-life benchmark in the area of Activity Recognition applications, as described in [1]. 

The classification tasks consist in predicting the activity performed by the user from time-series generated by a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), according to the EvAAL competition technical annex (http://evaal.aaloa.org/). 

In our activity recognition system we use information coming the implicit alteration of the wireless channel due to the movements of the user. The devices measure the RSS of the beacon packets they exchange among themselves in the WSN [2].

We collect RSS data using IRIS nodes embedding a Chipcon AT86RF230 radio subsystem that implements the IEEE 802.15.4 standard and programmed with a TinyOS firmware. They are placed on the userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chest and ankles. For the purpose of communications, the beacon packets are exchanged by using a simple virtual token protocol that completes its execution in a time slot of 50 milliseconds. A modified version of the Spin (http://span.ece.utah.edu/spin) token-passing protocol is used to schedule node transmission, in order to prevent packet collisions and maintain high data collection rate. When an anchor is transmitting, all other anchors receive the packet and perform the RSS measurements. The payload of the transmitting packet is the set of RSS values between the transmitting node and the other sensors sampled during the previous cycle.

From the raw data we extract time-domain features to compress the time series and slightly remove noise and correlations.

We choose an epoch time of 250 milliseconds according to the EVAAL technical annex. In such a time slot we elaborate 5 samples of RSS (sampled at 20 Hz) for each of the three couples of WSN nodes (i.e. Chest-Right Ankle, Chest-Left Ankle, Right Ankle-Left Ankle). The features include the mean value and standard deviation for each reciprocal RSS reading from worn WSN sensors.

For each activity 15 temporal sequences of input RSS data are present. The dataset contains 480 sequences, for a total number of 42240 instances.

We also consider two kind of bending activity, illustrated in the figure provided (bendingTupe.pdf). The positions of sensor nodes with the related identifiers are shown in figure sensorsPlacement.pdf.","F. Palumbo, C. Gallicchio, R. Pucci and A.

Pulsars are a rare type of Neutron star that produce radio emission detectable here on Earth. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the inter-stellar medium, and states of matter (see [2] for more uses). 

As pulsars rotate, their emission beam sweeps across the sky, and when this crosses our line of sight, produces a detectable pattern of broadband radio emission. As pulsars
rotate rapidly, this pattern repeats periodically. Thus pulsar search involves looking for periodic radio signals with large radio telescopes.

Each pulsar produces a slightly different emission pattern, which varies slightly with each rotation (see [2] for an introduction to pulsar astrophysics to find out why). Thus a  potential signal detection known as a 'candidate', is averaged over many rotations of the pulsar, as determined by the length of an observation. In the absence of additional info, each candidate could potentially describe a real pulsar. However in practice almost all detections are caused by radio frequency interference (RFI) and noise, making legitimate signals hard to find.

Machine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis. Classification systems in particular are being widely adopted,
(see [4,5,6,7,8,9]) which treat the candidate data sets  as binary classification problems. Here the legitimate pulsar examples are a minority positive class, and spurious examples the majority negative class. At present multi-class labels are unavailable, given the costs associated with data annotation.

The data set shared here contains 16,259 spurious examples caused by RFI/noise, and 1,639 real pulsar examples. These examples have all been checked by human annotators. 

The data is presented in two formats: CSV and ARFF (used by the WEKA data mining tool). Candidates are stored in both files in separate rows. Each row lists the variables first, and the class label is the final entry. The class labels used are 0 (negative) and 1 (positive).

Please note that the data contains no positional information or other astronomical details. It is simply feature data extracted from candidate files using the PulsarFeatureLab tool (see [10]).","If you use the dataset in your work, please cite us using the following paper:

","Database contains records for 1885 respondents. For each respondent 12 attributes are known: Personality measurements which include NEO-FFI-R (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness), BIS-11 (impulsivity), and ImpSS (sensation seeking), level of education, age, gender, country of residence and ethnicity. All input attributes are originally categorical and are quantified. After quantification values of all input features can be considered as real-valued. In addition, participants were questioned concerning their use of 18 legal and illegal drugs (alcohol, amphetamines, amyl nitrite, benzodiazepine, cannabis, chocolate, cocaine, caffeine, crack, ecstasy, heroin, ketamine, legal highs, LSD, methadone, mushrooms, nicotine and volatile substance abuse and one fictitious drug (Semeron) which was introduced to identify over-claimers. For each drug they have to select one of the answers: never used the drug, used it over a decade ago, or in the last decade, year, month, week, or day.
Database contains 18 classification problems. Each of independent label variables contains seven classes: ""Never Used"", ""Used over a Decade Ago"", ""Used in Last Decade"", ""Used in Last Year"", ""Used in Last Month"", ""Used in Last Week"", and ""Used in Last Day"".

Problem which can be solved:
* Seven class classifications for each drug separately.
* Problem can be transformed to binary classification by union of part of classes into one new class. For example, ""Never Used"", ""Used over a Decade Ago"" form class ""Non-user"" and all other classes form class ""User"".
* The best binarization of classes for each attribute.
* Evaluation of risk to be drug consumer for each drug.

377,Geo-Magnetic field and WLAN dataset for indoor localisation from wristband and smartphone,"Paolo Barsocchi, Antonino Crivello, Davide La Rosa, Filippo Palumbo

{name.surname}@isti.cnr.it ","Indoor localisation is a key topic for the Ambient Intelligence (AmI) research community. 

In this scenarios, recent advancements in wearable technologies, particularly smartwatches with built-in sensors, and personal devices, such as smartphones, are being seen as the breakthrough for making concrete the envisioned Smart Environment (SE) paradigm. 

In particular, scenarios devoted to indoor localization represent a key challenge to be addressed. Many works try to solve the indoor localization issue, but the lack of a common dataset or frameworks to compare and evaluate solutions represent a big barrier to be overcome in the Ã¯Â¬Âeld. The unavailability and uncertainty of public datasets hinders the  possibility to compare different indoor localization algorithms. This constitutes the main motivation of the proposed dataset described herein. 

We collected Wi-Fi and geo-magnetic Ã¯Â¬Âeld Ã¯Â¬Ângerprints, together with inertial sensor data during two campaigns performed in the same environment. Retrieving syncronized data from a smartwatch and a smartphone worn by users at the purpose of create and present a public available dataset is the goal of this work.

First, they cannot identify the relations between weights of stock-picking concepts and performances of portfolios. Second, they cannot systematically discover the optimal combination for weights of concepts to optimize the performances. Third, they are unable to meet various investorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ preferences. This study aims to more efficiently construct weighted scoring stock selection models to overcome these disadvantages. Since the weights of stock-picking concepts in a weighted scoring stock selection model can be regarded as components in a mixture, we used the simplex centroid mixture design to obtain the experimental sets of weights. These sets of weights are simulated with US stock market historical data to obtain their performances. Performance prediction models were built with the simulated performance data set and artificial neural networks. Furthermore, the optimization models to reflect investorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ preferences were built up, and the performance prediction models were employed as the kernel of the optimization models so that the optimal solutions can now be solved with optimization techniques. The empirical values of the performances of the optimal weighting combinations generated by the optimization models showed that they can meet various investorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ preferences and outperform those of S&PÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 500 not only during the training period but also during the testing period.","Liu, Y.

    christian.duncan@quinnipiac.edu","A Vicon motion capture camera system was used to record 12 users performing 5 hand postures with markers attached to a left-handed glove. 

A rigid pattern of markers on the back of the glove was used to establish a local coordinate system for the hand, and 11 other markers were attached to the thumb and fingers of the glove. 3 markers were attached to the thumb with one above the thumbnail and the other two on the knuckles. 2 markers were attached to each finger with one above the fingernail and the other on the joint between the proximal and middle phalanx.

The 11 markers not part of the rigid pattern were unlabeled; their positions were not explicitly tracked. Consequently, there is no a priori correspondence between the markers of two given records. In addition, due to the resolution of the capture volume and self-occlusion due to the orientation and configuration of the hand and fingers, many records have missing markers. Extraneous markers were also possible due to artifacts in the Vicon software's marker reconstruction/recording process and other objects in the capture volume. As a result, the number of visible markers in a record varied considerably.

The data presented here is already partially preprocessed. First, all markers were transformed to the local coordinate system of the record containing them. Second, each transformed marker with a norm greater than 200 millimeters was pruned. Finally, any record that contained fewer than 3 markers was removed. The processed data has at most 12 markers per record and at least 3. For more information, see 'Attribute Information'.

Due to the manner in which data was captured, it is likely that for a given record and user there exists a near duplicate record originating from the same user. We recommend therefore to evaluate classification algorithms on a leave-one-user-out basis wherein each user is iteratively left out from training and used as a test set. One then tests the generalization of the algorithm to new users. A 'User' attribute is provided to accomodate this strategy. 

This dataset may be used for a variety of tasks, the most obvious of which is posture recognition via classification. One may also attempt user identification. Alternatively, one may perform clustering (constrained or unconstrained) to discover marker distributions either as an attempt to predict marker identities or obtain statistical descriptions/visualizations of the postures.

In previous work, we randomly sampled without replacement a constant number (e.g. 75) of records per class per user in order to balance classes.

#  DATA DESCRIPTION
#  ====================================================================
#  The following is a detailed description of the data contained in the
#  accompanying files.
#
#  INTRODUCTION
#  ------------
#
#  The data contained in these files were collected over a period of
#  several semesters from students engaged in software engineering
#  classes at San Francisco State University (class sections of CSC
#  640, CSC 648 and CSC 848).  All students consented to this data
#  being shared for research purposes provided no uniquely identifiable
#  information was contained in the distributed files.  The information
#  was collected through various means, with emphasis being placed on
#  the collection of objective, quantifiable information.  For more
#  information on the data collection procedures, please see the paper
#  referenced above.
#
#
#  PRIVACY
#  -------
#  The data contained in this file does not contain any information
#  which may be individually traced to a particular student who
#  participated in the study.
#
#
#  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DATA SOURCES AND DERIVATIONS
#  -------------------------------------------------
#  SAMs (Student Activity Measure) are collected for each student team
#  member during their participation in a software engineering class.
#  Student teams work together on a final class project, and comprise
#  5-6 students.  Teams that are made up of students from only one
#  school are labeled local teams.  Teams made up of students from more
#  than one school are labeled global teams.  SAMs are collected from:
#  weekly timecards, instructor observations, and software engineering
#  tool usage logs.  SAMs are then aggregated by team and time interval
#  (see next section) into TAMs (Team Activity Measure).  Outcomes are
#  determined at the end of the semester through evaluation of student
#  team work in two categories:  software engineering process (how well
#  the team applied best software engineering practices), and software
#  engineering product (the quality of the finished product the team
#  produced).  Thus for each team, two outcomes are determined, process
#  and product, respectively.  Outcomes are classified into two class
#  grades, A or F.  A represents teams that are at or above
#  expectations, F represents teams that are below expectations or need
#  attention.  For more information, please see the paper referenced
#  above.
#
#  The SE process and SE product outcomes represent ML training classes
#  and are to be considered separately, e.g. one should train ML for SE
#  process separately from training for SE product.
#
#  TIME INTERVALS FOR WHICH DATA IS COLLECTED
#  ------------------------------------------
#  Data collected continuously throughout the semester are aggregated
#  into different time intervals for the semester's project reflecting
#  different dynamics of teamwork during the class.  Time intervals
#  represent time periods in which a milestone was developed by each
#  team.  A milestone represents a major deliverable point in the class
#  for all student teams.  The milestones are roughly divided into the
#  following topics:
#
#            M1 - high level requirements and specs
#            M2 - more detailed requirements and specs
#            M3 - first prototype
#            M4 - beta release
#            M5 - final delivery
#
#  Time intervals are combinations of the time in which milestones are
#  being produced.  Time intervals are used in research only.
#
#  In addition to time intervals corresponding to milestones, a number
#  of time intervals combining multiple T1-T5 time intervals have been
#  calculated.  This was done to group student activities into design
#  vs. implementation phases which have different dynamics.
#
#  These time intervals are defined as follows:
#
#      Time Interval        Corresponding Milestone Periods in Class
#    -----------------    --------------------------------------------
#           0               Milestone 0
#           1               Milestone 1
#           2               Milestone 2
#           3               Milestone 3
#           4               Milestone 4
#           5               Milestone 5
#           6               Milestone 1 - Milestone 2 inclusive
#           7               Milestone 1 - Milestone 3 inclusive
#           8               Milestone 1 - Milestone 4 inclusive
#           9               Milestone 1 - Milestone 5 inclusive
#          10               Milestone 4 - Milestone 5 inclusive

#
#  TAM FEATURE NAMING CONVENTION
#  -----------------------------
#  A systematic approach to aggregating and naming TAM features was
#  developed.  By using this systematic approach, TAM feature names are
#  produced that are human understandable and intuitive and related to
#  aggregation method.
#
#
#  There are a number of base TAM which are then aggregated into
#  aggregated TAM.
#
#  BASE TAM
#  --------
#
#  General TAM
#  -----------
#  The following TAMs are collected for each team: Year, semester,
#  timeInterval, teamNumber, semesterId, teamMemberCount,
#  femaleTeamMembersPercent, teamLeadGender, teamDistribution
#
#  Calculated TAM
#  --------------
#  For each team, TAM were calculated from SAMs for every time interval
#  Ti.  The core TAM variables where for each we compute as applicable:
#  count, average, standard deviation over weeks, over students etc.
#
#  TAMs collected by Weekly Time Cards (WTS) TAM
#  ---------------------------------------------
#  teamMemberResponseCount, meetingHours, inPersonMeetingHours.
#  nonCodingDeliverablesHours, codingDeliverablesHours, helpHours,
#  globalLeadAdminHours, LeadAdminHoursResponseCount,
#  GlobalLeadAdminHoursResponseCount
#
#  TAMs collected  by Tool Logs (TL) TAM
#  -------------------------------------
#  commitCount, uniqueCommitMessageCount, uniqueCommitMessagePercent,
#  CommitMessageLength
#
#  Collected by Instructor Observations (IO) TAMs
#  ------------------------------------------------
#  issueCount, onTimeIssueCount, lateIssueCount
#
#
#  AGGREGATED TAM
#  --------------
#
#  Several aggregation method and derived variable names for TAMs
#  reflect how the core TAM variables were aggregated in final TAM
#  measures for each time interval Ti:
#
#  Let VAR be the core TAM variable above. The naming conventions and
#  aggregation operators to obtain TAMs for each time interval Ti were
#  as follows:
#
#  <VAR>Total - total sum of VAR in the time interval Ti
#  <VAR>Average - average of VAR in the time interval
#  <VAR>StandardDeviation - SD of variable in time interval
#  <VAR>Count - count of events measured by VAR (e.g. missed
#  checkpoints) in time interval
#  Average<VAR>ByWeek - total sum/count of VAR in the time interval
#  divided by weeks in time interval
#  StandradDeviation<VAR>ByWeek - the standard devation of the weekly
#  total of VAR taken over the time interval
#  Average<VAR>ByStudent - total count/sum of VAR in time interval,
#  divided by number of students in the team
#  StandardDeviation <VAR>ByStudent - standard deviation of  VAR in the
#  time interval, over students in the team
#
#
#  NULL VALUES
#  -----------
#  NULL values are used in the training data to indicate that no SAMs
#  were recorded in that particular time period, week, or for that
#  student.
#
#  Frequently TAM features involving teamLeadHours or globalTeamLead
#  hours will result in a NULL for a particular training sample.  For
#  local team leads, that usually means that the local team lead did
#  not complete any timecard surveys for the aggregation in quesiton.
#  While for global team lead TAM features this may also be the case,
#  the more usual cause of NULLS in global team lead TAM features comes
#  from the fact that most teams are not global, and therefore this
#  statistic was not gathered for these teams.
#
#  It is left to the individual researcher to decide how to accomodate
#  NULL values, and the data is included in this file.  Though these
#  may not be useful for machine learning directly, valuable
#  information can be obatined with some processing.
#
#  TAM FEATURES
#  ------------
#  The following is a list of tam features available in the data files.
#  The TAM feature names are listed in the order in which the data
#  appear in each training sample, i.e. the first feature corresponds
#  to the first column, the second feature corresponds to the second
#  column, etc.
#
#  The first sample line in the data section of the data file is not a
#  true sample, but consists of TAM feature names, which allows for
#  easy import into spreadsheets and for human readability.
#
#  The final two TAM features (columns) are the outcome data for
#  process and product, and are the last two columns in each sample
#  row.  The training sample data follow the header comment section.

From all subjects, three types of handwriting recordings (Static Spiral Test (SST), Dynamic Spiral Test (DST) and Stability Test on Certain Point (STCP)) are taken. Also the drawings of spirals belongs to the PWP are included in the dataset as image. Therefore, this dataset can also be used for regression. 

Handwriting dataset was constructed using Wacom Cintiq 12WX graphics (Hahne et al., 2009) table. It is basically a graphics tablet and LCD monitor rolled into one. It enables to display a PC's screen on its monitor and only interacts with digitized pens. Special software was designed for recording handwriting drawings and testing the coordination of the PD patients using the recordings. The software uses API functions of the device and was developed in C# platform which can be run on Windows systems You can contact with the authors to request the software which is mentioned [1]. 

In this study, there are three different kinds of tests developed for the data collection via graphics tablet. The first one isthe Static Spiral Test (SST) which is frequently used for clinical research in the literature for different purposes like determining motor performance (Wang et al., 2008), measuring tremor (Pullman, 1998) and diagnosing PD (Saunders et al., 2008). In this test, three wound Archimedean spirals appears on the graphics tablet using the software and patients were asked to retrace the same spiral as much as they can using the digital pen. During the test, the features which are mentioned above and the other data to specify the patient are recorded to the database. 

The second test is the Dynamic Spiral Test (DST). Unlike SST, Archimedean spiral just appears and disappears in certain time intervals, in other words the Archimedean spiral blinks. This forces the patient to keep the pattern in mind and continue to draw. The purpose of this test is to determine the change in patient's drawing performance and pause times since it is more difficult to retrace the Archimedean spiral in this case. As a result of this test, it is observed that most of the patients continued drawing but nearly all of them lost the pattern. 

The third test is Stability Test on Certain Point (STCP). In this test, there is a certain red point in the middle of the screen and the subjects are asked to hold the digital pen on the point without touching the screen in a certain time. The purpose of this test is to determine the patient's hand stability or hand tremor level.

The crowdsourced polygons cover only a small part of the image area, and are used used to extract training data from the image for classifying the rest of the image. The main challenge with the dataset is that both the imagery and the crowdsourced data contain noise (due to cloud cover in the images and innaccurate labeling/digitizing of polygons).

-The 'training.csv' file contains the training data for classification. Do not use this file to evaluate classification accuracy because it contains noise (many class labeling errors).

    christian.duncan@quinnipiac.edu","A Vicon motion capture camera system was used to record 12 users performing 5 hand postures with markers attached to a left-handed glove. 

A rigid pattern of markers on the back of the glove was used to establish a local coordinate system for the hand, and 11 other markers were attached to the thumb and fingers of the glove. 3 markers were attached to the thumb with one above the thumbnail and the other two on the knuckles. 2 markers were attached to each finger with one above the fingernail and the other on the joint between the proximal and middle phalanx.

The 11 markers not part of the rigid pattern were unlabeled; their positions were not explicitly tracked. Consequently, there is no a priori correspondence between the markers of two given records. In addition, due to the resolution of the capture volume and self-occlusion due to the orientation and configuration of the hand and fingers, many records have missing markers. Extraneous markers were also possible due to artifacts in the Vicon software's marker reconstruction/recording process and other objects in the capture volume. As a result, the number of visible markers in a record varied considerably.

The data presented here is already partially preprocessed. First, all markers were transformed to the local coordinate system of the record containing them. Second, each transformed marker with a norm greater than 200 millimeters was pruned. Finally, any record that contained fewer than 3 markers was removed. The processed data has at most 12 markers per record and at least 3. For more information, see 'Attribute Information'.

Due to the manner in which data was captured, it is likely that for a given record and user there exists a near duplicate record originating from the same user. We recommend therefore to evaluate classification algorithms on a leave-one-user-out basis wherein each user is iteratively left out from training and used as a test set. One then tests the generalization of the algorithm to new users. A 'User' attribute is provided to accomodate this strategy. 

This dataset may be used for a variety of tasks, the most obvious of which is posture recognition via classification. One may also attempt user identification. Alternatively, one may perform clustering (constrained or unconstrained) to discover marker distributions either as an attempt to predict marker identities or obtain statistical descriptions/visualizations of the postures.

In previous work, we randomly sampled without replacement a constant number (e.g. 75) of records per class per user in order to balance classes.

It is a multilabel dataset with three columns of labels. This dataset was created segmenting 60 audio records belonging to 4 different families, 8 genus, and 10 species. Each audio corresponds to one specimen (an individual frog), the record ID is also included as an extra column. We used the spectral entropy and a binary cluster method to detect audio frames belonging to each syllable. The segmentation and feature extraction were carried out in Matlab. After the segmentation we got 7195 syllables, which became instances for train and test the classifier. These records were collected in situ under real noise conditions (the background sound). Some species are from the campus of Federal University of Amazonas, Manaus, others from Mata AtlÃƒÂ¢ntica, Brazil, and one of them from CÃƒÂ³rdoba, Argentina. The recordings were stored in wav format with 44.1kHz of sampling frequency and 32bit of resolution, which allows us to analyze signals up to 22kHz. From every extracted syllable 22 MFCCs were calculated by using 44 triangular filters. These coefficients were normalized between -1 Ã¢â€°Â¤ mfcc Ã¢â€°Â¤ 1. The amount of instances per class are:

408,Gastrointestinal Lesions in Regular Colonoscopy,"Pablo Mesejo, pablomesejo@gmail.com, Inria, France
Daniel Pizarro, dani.pizarro@gmail.com, University of AlcalÃƒÂ¡, Spain","This dataset contains the features extracted from a database of colonoscopic videos showing gastrointestinal lesions. It also contains the ground truth collected from both expert image inspection and histology (in an xlsx file). There are features vectors for 76 lesions, and there are 3 types of lesion: hyperplasic, adenoma and serrated adenoma. It is possible to consider this classification problem as a binary one by combining adenoma and serrated adenoma in the same class. According to this, hyperplasic lesions would belong to the class 'benign' while the other two types of gastrointestinal lesions would go to the 'malignant' class. 

The first line/row of the dataset corresponds to the lesion name (text label). Every lesion appears twice because it has been recorded using two types of lights: white light (WL) and narrow band imaging (NBI). The second line/row represents the type of lesion (3 for adenoma, 1 for hyperplasic, and 2 for serrated). And, finally, the third line/row is the type of light used (1 for WL and 2 for NBI). All other rows are the raw features (without any kind of preprocessing):
422 2D TEXTURAL FEATURES
- First 166 features: AHT: Autocorrelation Homogeneous Texture (Invariant Gabor Texture)
- Next 256: Rotational Invariant LBP
76 2D COLOR FEATURES
- 16 Color Naming
- 13 Discriminative Color
- 7 Hue
- 7 Opponent
- 33 color gray-level co-occurrence matrix
200 3D SHAPE FEATURES
- 100 shapeDNA
- 100 KPCA

The main objective of this dataset is to study how good computers can be at diagnosing gastrointestinal lesions from regular colonoscopic videos. In order to compare the performance of machine learning methods with the one offered by humans, we provide the file ground_truth.xlsx that includes the ground truth after histopathology and the opinion of 7 clinicians (4 experts and 3 beginners). An automatic tissue classification approach could save clinician's time by avoiding chromoendoscopy, a time-consuming staining procedure using indigo carmine, as well as could help to assess the severity of individual lesions in patients with many polyps, so that the gastroenterologist would directly focus on those requiring polypectomy. A possible way of proceeding with the classification is to concatenate the information from the two types of light for each lesion, i.e. create a single vector of 1396 elements per lesion.

The technical goal is to maximize accuracy while minimizing false positives (lesions that do not need resection but that are classified as if they do) and false negatives (lesions that do need resection but that are classified as if they do not need it). In particular, we are specially interested on maximizing accuracy while reducing false negatives, i.e. minimizing the number of adenoma and serrated adenoma that are classified as hyperplasic. The opposite case is not that serious: the resection of a hyperplasic polyp considering it as an adenoma or serrated adenoma. Another interesting experiment would consist on compare the performance of the best machine learning method we can get with the one provided by human operators (experts and beginners).

The best results obtained so far, in the binary case, using leave-one-out and Random Forest with 1000 trees (using color+texture+3D with NBI), corresponded to an accuracy of ~89,5%, sensitivity ~94,5% and specificity ~76% (considering as positive condition the resection). This is the best confusion matrix found so far:
                     Classified as
		Resection	No-Resection
Resection       52			3
No-Resection	5			16

The best results obtained in the multi-class case, using leave-one-out and Random Subspace of SVMs (color+texture+3D using WL), were as follows:

4. Relevant Information:
   -- Introduction
     The dataset consists of data collected from heavy Scania 
     trucks in everyday usage. The system in focus is the 
     Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurised 
     air that are utilized in various functions in a truck, 
     such as braking and gear changes. The datasets' 
     positive class consists of component failures 
     for a specific component of the APS system. 
     The negative class consists of trucks with failures 
     for components not related to the APS. The data consists 
     of a subset of all available data, selected by experts. 

   -- Challenge metric  

     Cost-metric of miss-classification:

     Predicted class |      True class       |
                     |    pos    |    neg    |
     -----------------------------------------
      pos            |     -     |  Cost_1   |
     -----------------------------------------
      neg            |  Cost_2   |     -     |
     -----------------------------------------
     Cost_1 = 10 and cost_2 = 500

     The total cost of a prediction model the sum of 'Cost_1' 
     multiplied by the number of Instances with type 1 failure 
     and 'Cost_2' with the number of instances with type 2 failure, 
     resulting in a 'Total_cost'.

     In this case Cost_1 refers to the cost that an unnessecary 
     check needs to be done by an mechanic at an workshop, while 
     Cost_2 refer to the cost of missing a faulty truck, 
     which may cause a breakdown.

     Total_cost = Cost_1*No_Instances + Cost_2*No_Instances.

5. Number of Instances: 
     The training set contains 60000 examples in total in which 
     59000 belong to the negative class and 1000 positive class. 
     The test set contains 16000 examples. 

6. Number of Attributes: 171 

7. Attribute Information:
   The attribute names of the data have been anonymized for 
   proprietary reasons. It consists of both single numerical 
   counters and histograms consisting of bins with different 
   conditions. Typically the histograms have open-ended 
   conditions at each end. For example if we measuring 
   the ambient temperature 'T' then the histogram could 
   be defined with 4 bins where: 

   bin 1 collect values for temperature T < -20
   bin 2 collect values for temperature T >= -20 and T < 0     
   bin 3 collect values for temperature T >= 0 and T < 20  
   bin 4 collect values for temperature T > 20 

   |  b1  |  b2  |  b3  |  b4  |   
   ----------------------------- 
         -20     0      20

  The attributes are as follows: class, then 
  anonymized operational data. The operational data have 
  an identifier and a bin id, like 'Identifier_Bin'.
  In total there are 171 attributes, of which 7 are 
  histogram variabels. Missing values are denoted by 'na'.","If you have no special citation requests, please leave this field blank."," Industrial Challenge 2016 at The 15th International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA)

Lenguajes y Sistemas Informaticos Ã‚Â´ Universidad Nacional de Educacion a DistanciaÃ‚Â´ Madrid, Spain","This dataset provides ground-truth class labels to evaluate performance of multi-instance learning models on both instance-level and bag-level label predictions. DeliciousMIL was first used in [1] to evaluate performance of MLTM, a multi-label multi-instance learning method, for document classification and sentence labeling.

Multi-instance learning is a special class of weakly supervised machine learning methods where the learner receives a collection of labeled bags each containing multiple instances. A bag is set to have a particular class label if and only if at least one of its instances has that class label.

DeliciousMIL consists of a subset of tagged web pages from the social bookmarking site delicious.com. The original web pages were obtained from DeliciousT140 dataset, which was collected by [2] from the delicious.com in June 2008. Users of the website delicious.com bookmarked each page with word tags. From this dataset, we extracted text parts of each web page and chose 20 common tags as class labels. These class labels are:
reference, design, programming, internet, computer, web, java, writing, English, grammar, style, language, books, education, philosophy, politics, religion, science, history, and culture.

We randomly selected 12234 pages and randomly divided them into 8251 training and 3983 test documents. We also applied Porter stemming and standard stopword removal. 

Each text document is a bag within a multi-instance learning framework consisting of multiple sentences (instances). The goal is to predict document-level and sentence-level class labels on the test set using a model which is trained given only the document-level class labels in the training set.
To evaluate performance of such a model, we have manually labeled 1468 randomly selected sentences from the test documents. Please see [1] for more information. ","If you use DeliciousMIL, please cite:

4. Relevant Information:
   -- Introduction
     The dataset consists of data collected from heavy Scania 
     trucks in everyday usage. The system in focus is the 
     Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurised 
     air that are utilized in various functions in a truck, 
     such as braking and gear changes. The datasets' 
     positive class consists of component failures 
     for a specific component of the APS system. 
     The negative class consists of trucks with failures 
     for components not related to the APS. The data consists 
     of a subset of all available data, selected by experts. 

   -- Challenge metric  

     Cost-metric of miss-classification:

     Predicted class |      True class       |
                     |    pos    |    neg    |
     -----------------------------------------
      pos            |     -     |  Cost_1   |
     -----------------------------------------
      neg            |  Cost_2   |     -     |
     -----------------------------------------
     Cost_1 = 10 and cost_2 = 500

     The total cost of a prediction model the sum of 'Cost_1' 
     multiplied by the number of Instances with type 1 failure 
     and 'Cost_2' with the number of instances with type 2 failure, 
     resulting in a 'Total_cost'.

     In this case Cost_1 refers to the cost that an unnessecary 
     check needs to be done by an mechanic at an workshop, while 
     Cost_2 refer to the cost of missing a faulty truck, 
     which may cause a breakdown.

     Total_cost = Cost_1*No_Instances + Cost_2*No_Instances.

5. Number of Instances: 
     The training set contains 60000 examples in total in which 
     59000 belong to the negative class and 1000 positive class. 
     The test set contains 16000 examples. 

6. Number of Attributes: 171 

7. Attribute Information:
   The attribute names of the data have been anonymized for 
   proprietary reasons. It consists of both single numerical 
   counters and histograms consisting of bins with different 
   conditions. Typically the histograms have open-ended 
   conditions at each end. For example if we measuring 
   the ambient temperature 'T' then the histogram could 
   be defined with 4 bins where: 

   bin 1 collect values for temperature T < -20
   bin 2 collect values for temperature T >= -20 and T < 0     
   bin 3 collect values for temperature T >= 0 and T < 20  
   bin 4 collect values for temperature T > 20 

   |  b1  |  b2  |  b3  |  b4  |   
   ----------------------------- 
         -20     0      20

  The attributes are as follows: class, then 
  anonymized operational data. The operational data have 
  an identifier and a bin id, like 'Identifier_Bin'.
  In total there are 171 attributes, of which 7 are 
  histogram variabels. Missing values are denoted by 'na'.",,"Costa C.F., Nascimento M.A. (2016) IDA 2016 Industrial Challenge: Using Machine Learning for Predicting Failures.

The dataset contains 49 features selected according to the EASL-EORTC (European Association for the Study of the Liver - European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) Clinical Practice Guidelines, which are the current state-of-the-art on the management of HCC.

This is an heterogeneous dataset, with 23 quantitative variables, and 26 qualitative variables. Overall, missing data represents 10.22% of the whole dataset and only eight patients have complete information in all fields (4.85%). The target variables is the survival at 1 year, and was encoded as a binary variable: 0 (dies) and 1 (lives). A certain degree of class-imbalance is also present (63 cases labeled as Ã¢â‚¬Å“diesÃ¢â‚¬Â and 102 as Ã¢â‚¬Å“livesÃ¢â‚¬Â).

Data is sparse and noisy due to the use of a passive sensor. 
Participants were allocated in two clinical room settings (S1 and S2). The setting of S1 (Room1) uses 4 RFID reader antennas around the room (one on ceiling level, and 3 on wall level) for the collection of data, whereas the room setting S2 (Room2) uses 3 RFID reader antennas (two at ceiling level and one at wall level) for the collection of motion data. 
The activities performed were: 
 walking to the chair, 
 sitting on the chair, 
 getting off the chair, 
 walking to bed, 
 lying on bed, 
 getting off the bed and 
 walking to the door. 
Hence the possible class labels assigned for every sensor observation are:
- Sitting on bed
- Sitting on chair
- Lying on bed
- Ambulating, where ambulating includes standing, walking around the room.

","The dataset was created using the RSSI readings of an array of 13 ibeacons in the first floor of Waldo Library, Western Michigan University. Data was collected using iPhone 6S. The dataset contains two sub-datasets: a labeled dataset (1420 instances) and an unlabeled dataset (5191 instances). The recording was performed during the operational hours of the library. For the labeled dataset, the input data contains the location (label column), a timestamp, followed by RSSI readings of 13 iBeacons. RSSI measurements are negative values. Bigger RSSI values indicate closer proximity to a given iBeacon (e.g., RSSI of -65 represent a closer distance to a given iBeacon compared to RSSI of -85). For out-of-range iBeacons, the RSSI is indicated by -200. The locations related to RSSI readings are combined in one column consisting a letter for the column and a number for the row of the position. The attached figure depicts the layout of the iBeacons as well as the arrange of locations.

439,chipseq,"Toby Dylan Hocking
toby.hocking@mail.mcgill.ca
McGill University","These data are significant because they are among the first to provide
labels that formalize the genome-wide peak detection problem, which is
a very important problem for biomedical / epigenomics researchers. 
These labels can be used to train and test supervised
peak detection algorithms, as explained below.

The data are in problem directories such as

data/&ltSET&gt/samples/&ltGROUP&gt/&ltSAMPLE&gt/problems/&ltPROBLEM&gt

Each problem directory contains two files, labels.bed (weak labels)
and coverage.bedGraph.gz (inputs). 

Each coverage.bedGraph.gz file represents a vector of non-negative
integer count data, one entry for each genomic position in a subset of
the human genome hg19. For example

data/H3K9me3_TDH_BP/samples/tcell/ERS358697/problems/chr8:48135599-86500000/coverage.bedGraph.gz

represents a vector defined on all genomic positions from 48135600 to
86500000 on chr8 (for a particular tcell sample named ERS358697, in
the H3K9me3_TDH_BP data set). To save disk space the vectors are saved
using a run-length encoding; for example the first three lines of this
file are

chr8	48135599	48135625	0
chr8	48135625	48135629	1
chr8	48135629	48135632	2

which mean that the first 26 entries of the vector are 0, the next
four entries are 1, and the following three entries are 2. Note that
start positions are 0-based but end positions are 1-based, so the
first line means a 0 from all positions from 48135600 to 48135625
(excluding the start position 48135599 for which we have no
information).

The goal is to learn a function that takes the coverage.bedGraph.gz
file as input, and outputs a binary classification for every genomic
position. The positive class represents peaks (typically large counts)
and the negative class represents background noise (typically small
counts).

Weak labels are given in labels.bed files, each of which indicates
several regions of the genome with or without peaks. For example the
file

data/H3K4me3_XJ_immune/samples/bcell/McGill0091/problems/chr1:30028082-103863906/labels.bed

contains the 6 labels below:

chr1	33111786	33114894	noPeaks
chr1	33114941	33116174	peakStart
chr1	33116183	33116620	peakEnd
chr1	33116633	33116755	noPeaks
chr1	33116834	33118135	peaks
chr1	33118161	33120163	noPeaks

The four labels are interpreted as follows:

noPeaks: all of the predictions in this region should be negative /
background noise. For example the first line in the file above means
that for a vector x_i of count data from i=30028083 to i=103863906,
the desired function should predict negative / background noise
f(x_i)=0 from i=33111787 to i=33114894. If positive / peaks are
predicted f(x_i)=1 for any i in this region, that is counted as a
false positive label.

peakStart: there should be exactly one peak start predicted in this
region. A peak start is defined as a position i such that a peak is
predicted there f(x_i)=1 but not at the previous position
f(x_{i-1})=0. The exact position is unspecified; any position is fine,
as long as there is only one start in the region. Predicting exactly
one peak start in this region results in a true positive. More starts
is a false positive, and fewer starts is a false negative. For
example,

 [peakStart] 
0 0 0 1 1 1 1 -> correct.  
0 0 1 1 1 1 1 -> also correct.  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -> false negative (no peak starts).
0 0 1 0 1 1 1 -> flase positive (two peak starts).

peakEnd: there should be exactly one peak end predicted in this
region. A peak end is defined as a position i such that a peak is
predicted there f(x_i)=1 but not at the next position f(x_{i+1})=0.
The exact position is unspecified; any position is fine, as long as
there is only one end in the region. Predicting exactly one peak end
in this region results in a true positive. More ends is a false
positive, and fewer ends is a false negative. For example,

 [ peakEnd ] 
1 1 1 1 0 0 0 -> correct.  
1 1 1 1 1 0 0 -> also correct.  
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -> false negative (no peak ends).
1 1 1 0 1 0 0 -> flase positive (two peak ends).

peaks: there should be at least one peak predicted somewhere in this
region (anywhere is fine). Zero predicted peaks in this region is a
false negative. If there is a predicted peak somewhere in this region
that is a true positive.

For a particular set of predicted peaks f(x), the total number of
incorrect labels (false positives + false negatives) can be computed
as an evaluation metric (smaller is better). Typically the peak
predictions are also stored using a run-length encoding; the error
rates can be computed using the reference implementation in R package
PeakError, https://github.com/tdhock/PeakError

Receiver Operating Characteristic curves can be computed for a family
of predicted peaks f_lambda(x), where lambda is some significance
threshold, intercept parameter, etc. Compute the TPR and FPR as follows:

TPR = (total number of true positives)/(total number of labels that could have a true positive)
 = (number of correct peaks, peakStart, peakEnd labels)/(number of peaks, peakStart, peakEnd labels)

FPR = (total number of false positives)/(total number of labels that could have a false positive)
 = (
number of peakStart/End labels with two or more predicted starts/end + 
number of noPeaks labels with predicted peaks
)/(number of peakStart, peakEnd, and noPeaks labels)

Suggested fold ID numbers for four-fold cross-validation experiments
can be found in data/*/folds.csv files. For example
data/H3K36me3_TDH_other/folds.csv contains

problem,fold
chr16:8686921-32000000,1
chr16:60000-8636921,1
chr21:43005559-44632664,2
chr14:19050000-107289540,3
chr15:29209443-77800000,4

which means that problems chr16:8686921-32000000 and
chr16:60000-8636921 should be considered fold ID 1,
chr21:43005559-44632664 should be considered fold ID 2, etc. This
means that for data set H3K36me3_TDH_other, the fold ID 2 consists of
all data in
data/H3K36me3_TDH_other/samples/*/*/problems/chr21:43005559-44632664
directories.

There are several types of learning settings that could be used with
these data. Here are four examples.

Unsupervised learning. Train models only using the
coverage.bedGraph.gz files. Only use the labels for evaluation (not
for training model parameters).

Supervised learning. Train models only using the coverage.bedGraph.gz
and labels.bed files in the train set. Use the labels in the test set
to evaluate prediction accuracy.

Semi-supervised learning. Train models using the coverage.bedGraph.gz
and labels.bed files in the train set. You can additionally use the
coverage.bedGraph.gz files in the test set at training time. Use the
labels in the test set to evaluate prediction accuracy.

Multi-task learning. Many data sets come from different experiment
types, so have different peak patterns. For example H3K4me3_TDH_immune
is a H3K4me3 histone modification (sharp peak pattern) and
H3K36me3_TDH_immune is a H3K36me3 histone modification (broad peak
pattern). Therefore it is not expected that models should generalize
between data sets. However there is something common across data sets
in that in each data set, the peak / positive class is large values,
wheras the noise / negative class is small values. Therefore
multi-task learning may be interesting. To compare a multi-task
learning model to a single-task learning model, use the suggested
cross-validation fold IDs. For test fold ID 1, train both the
multi-task and single-task learning models using all other folds, then
make predictions on all data with fold ID 1.

","CASTEP can simulate a wide range of properties of materials proprieties using density functional theory (DFT). DFT is the most successful method calculates atomic coordinates faster than other mathematical approaches, and it also reaches more accurate results. The dataset is generated with CASTEP using CNT geometry optimization. Many CNTs are simulated in CASTEP, then geometry optimizations are calculated. Initial coordinates of all carbon atoms are generated randomly. Different chiral vectors are used for each CNT simulation. The atom type is selected as carbon, bond length is used as 1.42 AÃ‚Â° (default value). CNT calculation parameters are used as default parameters. To finalize the computation, CASTEP uses a parameter named as elec_energy_tol (electrical energy tolerance) (default 1x10-5 eV) which represents that the change in the total energy from one iteration to the next remains below some tolerance value per atom for a few self-consistent field steps. Initial atomic coordinates (u, v, w), chiral vector (n, m) and calculated atomic coordinates (uÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, vÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, wÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) are obtained from the output files.","Please cite as:

Email: dangelo@unisannio.it","In pervasive computing the interacting users are not able to obtain information about the trustworthiness of each other. Thus, unfair users can act maliciously towards others. The proposed solution enables to evaluate the trustworthiness of each user by monitoring the behavior of each other during their interaction on the network. These behaviors are represented by tuples including significant parameters. Based on these tuples, the architecture combines some artificial intelligence-based technologies to implement a decision making system.
The tuples are as follows:
eij = <EIDj, CT,CU, LT, TC, TS >
where:

eij - i-th entity interacting with j-th entity.

EIDj - j-th entity Identification

CT - Counting Trust. It is used to count how many trustworthy transactions (belonging to a specific context) occur after the last untrustworthy transaction.
CU - Counting Un-trust. It is used to count how many untrustworthy transactions (belonging to a specific context) occur after the last trustworthy transaction.
LT - Last Time. It is used to take into account of the date at which the last experience in a specific context took place.
TC - Transactions Context. It is used to identify the type of transaction, such as game, e-commerce, social network and others.
TS - Trust Score. It  is the score that an entity gives to another entity at the end of each direct interaction.


The data set was obtained by a Java simulator which implemented the proposed architecture.
It includes data for the three most popular types of attack, namely:
- Counting-based attack. The user tries to gain a good reputation by alternating the honest and dishonest behavior.
- Time-based attack. User again tries to gain a good reputation by alternating the honest and dishonest behavior, but acts in different time.
- Context-based attack. R tries to gain a good reputation by acting honestly for a type of transaction and dishonestly for another one.

Because EIDj parameters are not relevant for the decision-making process, only the following parameters were reported in the dataset:
- CT
- CU
- LT
- TC
- TS

Because, there could be situation in which users have not historical data (tuples) for interacting with another one, it may get data (tuples) from third-parties who previously have had interaction with the inquired user.
Nevertheless, the trustworthiness of such third party entities (recommenders) needs to be evaluated also. Indeed, they may act through attacks, such as: Ballot Stuffing (BS), Bad mouthing , and Random opinion (RO).
Changing of the TS parameter for a number of rows in the dataset, and in according to a specific attack, allows to obtain different datasets useful for the recommenders trustworthiness evaluation.
According to this, the following datasets are also provided:
- BM_x%.txt  x is the percentage of unfair recommendations obtained by a BM attack. It ranges from 10 to 50.
- BS_x%.txt  x is the percentage of unfair recommendations obtained by a BS attack. It ranges from 10 to 50.
- RO_x%.txt  x is the percentage of unfair recommendations obtained by a BM attack. It ranges from 10 to 50.

The GDELT Project is an open platform for research and analysis of global society and thus all datasets released by the GDELT Project are available for unlimited and unrestricted use for any academic, commercial, or governmental use of any kind without fee.","To decrease the bias and create a reliable authorship attribution dataset the following criteria have been chosen to filter out authors in Gdelt database: English language writing authors, authors that have enough books available (at least 5), 19th century authors. With these criteria 50 authors have been selected and their books were queried through Big Query Gdelt database. The next task has been cleaning the dataset due to OCR reading problems in the original raw form. To achieve that, firstly all books have been scanned through to get the overall number of unique words and each words frequencies. While scanning the texts, the first 500 words and the last 500 words have been removed to take out specific features such as the name of the author, the name of the book and other word specific features that could make the classification task easier. After this step, we have chosen top 10,000 words that occurred in the whole 50 authors text data corpus. The words that are not in top 10,000 words were removed while keeping the rest of the sentence structure intact. The entire book is split into text fragments with 1000 words each. We separately maintained author and book identification number for each one of them in different arrays. Text segments with less than 1000 words were filled with zeros to keep them in the dataset as well. 1000 words make approximately 2 pages of writing, which is long enough to extract a variety of features from the document. Each instance in the training set consists of a text piece of 1000 words and an author id attached. In the testing set, there is only the text piece of 1000 words to do authorship attribution. Training data consists of 45 authors and testing data has 50 information. %34 of testing data is the percentile of unknown authors in the testing set.  ","Please site our work :

felix.graesser@tu-dresden.de","The dataset provides patient reviews on specific drugs along with related conditions and a 10 star patient rating reflecting overall patient satisfaction. The data was obtained by crawling online pharmaceutical review sites. The intention was to study 

(1) sentiment analysis of drug experience over multiple facets, i.e. sentiments learned on specific aspects such as effectiveness and side effects,
(2) the transferability of models among domains, i.e. conditions, and 
(3) the transferability of models among different data sources (see 'Drug Review Dataset (Druglib.com)').

The data is split into a train (75%) a test (25%) partition (see publication) and stored in two .tsv (tab-separated-values) files, respectively.

Details of the dataset:
The frequency domain measurement of the scattering parameter, S21, of the wireless channel was carried out using the ZVB14 Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) from Rhode and Schwartz. The measurement system consists of the VNA, low loss RF cables, and omnidirectional antennas at the transmitter and receiver ends. The transmitter and receiver heights were fixed at 1.5 m. A program script was written for the VNA to measure 10 consecutive sweeps: each sweep contains 601 frequency sample points with spacing of 0.167 MHz to cover a 100 MHz band centered at 2.4 GHz. The settings provided a high time-domain resolution of 10 nsec (inverse of the bandwidth) and a time span of (0.167 MHz) = 5.99ÃŽÂ¼sec . The measurements were designed to examine the WiFi bands specifically, channels 1, 6, and 11 in the IEEE 802.11 standard.
 
The frequency domain channel measurements were conducted at Khalifa University campus in Sharjah, UAE. The measurements were done in 4 different locations:
1- Lab139 (highly cluttered) 
2- Corridor_rm155 (medium cluttered) [with wall from one side and windows from the other side].
3- Main_Lobby (low cluttered) 
4- Sports_Hall (open space). 
 
The layout of the floor plan is shown in Floor_Plan.pdf where the red circle represents the transmitter and the green circle represent the receiver location.
 
The square area was divided into uniform grids with a spacing of one wavelength (12.5 cm) that resulted in a total number of 196 points to capture the small-scale variations. The database was measured under a stationary scenario where there were no movements around the Tx/Rx at the time of measurements. This is achieved since the survey is conducted during low-activity time. This gives a total of 1960 samples because each point has 10 measurements. 
 
In the case of Lab139 there is one set of measurements where the furthest point between the Tx/Rx is 7.1m and then the  receiver will moved across the uniform grid. This gives a total of 1960 points.
 
In the case of Corridor_rm155 there are three set of measurements where the furthest point between Tx/Rx is 7.1m and this gives a total of 1960 points.

In the case of Main_Lobby there are three set of measurements where the furthest point between Tx/Rx is 7.1m  and this gives a total of 1960 points.
 
In the case of Sport_Hall there is one set of measurements where the furthest point between the Tx/Rx is 7.1m and this gives a total of 1960 points.
  
filename format (environment_Tx/Rx(separation)) i.e Corridor_rm155_7.1 : The environment is a narrow corridor with walls from one side and window from the other side and the Tx/Rx maximum separation is 7.1m and as the receiver is moved across the uniform grid it decreases.
 
Each file will Loc_xxxx and this will resemble the location of the receiver and each location have ten measurements. The flow of
numbers on the uniform grid is shown in Flow_of_Numbering.pdf

A chemical detection platform composed of 14 temperature-modulated metal oxide semiconductor (MOX) gas sensors was exposed to dynamic mixtures of carbon monoxide (CO) and humid synthetic air in a gas chamber. 

The acquired time series of the sensors and the measured values of CO concentration, humidity and temperature inside the gas chamber are provided. 

a) Chemical detection platform: 
The chemical detection platform was composed of 14 MOX gas sensors that generate a time-dependent multivariate response to the different gas stimuli. 
The utilized sensors were made commercially available by Figaro Engineering (7 units of TGS 3870-A04) and FIS (7 units of SB-500-12).
The operating temperature of the sensors was controlled by the built-in heater, which voltage was modulated in the range 0.2-0.9 V in cycles of 20 and 25 s, following the manufacturer recommendations (0.9 V for 5s, 0.2 V for 20s, 0.9 V for 5 s, 0.2 V for 25 s, ...). 
The sensors were pre-heated for one week before starting the experiments.
The MOX read-out circuits consisted of voltage dividers with 1 MOhm load resistors and powered at 5V.
The output voltage of the sensors was sampled at 3.5 Hz using an Agilent HP34970A/34901A DAQ configured at 15 bits of precision and input impedance greater than 10 GOhm.

b) Generator of dynamic gas mixtures
Dynamic mixtures of CO and humid synthetic air were delivered from high purity gases in cylinders to a small-sized polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) test chamber (250 cm3 internal volume), by means of a piping system and mass flow controllers (MFCs).
Gas mixing was performed using mass flow controllers (MFC),which controlled three different gas streams (CO, wet air and dry air). These streams were delivered from high quality pressurized
gases in cylinders. 
The selected MFCs (EL-FLOW Select, Bronkhorst) had full scale flow rates of 1000 mln/min for the dry and wet air streams and 3 mln/min for the CO channel. 
The CO bottle contained 1600 ppm of CO diluted in synthetic air with 21 Ã‚Â± 1% O2. 
The relative uncertainty in the generated CO concentration was below 5.5%.
The wet and dry air streams were both delivered from a synthetic air bottle with 99.995% purity and 21 Ã‚Â± 1% O2. 
Humidification of the wet stream was based on the saturation method using a glass bubbler (Drechsler bottles). 

c)  Temperature/humidity values
A temperature/humidity sensor (SHT75, from Sensirion) provided reference humidity and temperature values inside the test chamber with tolerance below 1.8% r.h. and 0.5 Ã‚ÂºC, respectively, every 5 s.
The temperature variations inside the gas chamber, for each experiment, were below 3 Ã‚ÂºC. 

d) Experimental protocol: 
Each experiment consisted on 100 measurements: 10 experimental concentrations uniformly distributed in the range 0-20 ppm and 10 replicates per concentration. 
Each replicate had a relative humidity randomly chosen from a uniform distribution between 15% and 75% r.h. 
At the beginning of each experiment, the gas chamber was cleaned for 15 min using a stream of synthetic air at a flow rate of 240 mln/min. 
After that, the gas mixtures were released in random order at a constant flow rate of 240 mln/min for 15 min each. 
A single experiment lasted 25 hours (100 samples x 15 minutes/sample) and was replicated on 13 working days spanning a natural period of 17 days.

Email: carper@unex.es ","Important remarks before using this dataset: 

1. Each row can not be used independently, because is one of the three replications of one individual. Nature of data is dependent    for each subject, but independent from one to another subject. So, traditional technique from machine learning can not be applied to this dataset, because those techniques are based on the independent nature of the instances. There are 240 instances but for only 80 subjects, so they are not independent. Techniques as those presented in Naranjo et al. (2016), Naranjo et al. (2017) or other specifically designed can be used. 

2. The concept of replication considered here does not match the classical concept of statistical repeated measurements. The term 'replications' refers to the collection of features extracted from voice recordings belonging to the same subject. Since, in this context, features are extracted from multiple consecutive voice recordings from the same subject, in principle, the features should be identical. The imperfections in technology and the own biological variability result in non-identical replicated features that are more similar to one another than features from different subjects. 

3. All information about how the dataset was generated is presented in Naranjo et al. (2016).

The event log is enriched with data loaded from a relational database underlying a corresponding process-aware information system. Information was anonymized for privacy.

Number of instances: 141,712 events (24,918 incidents)
Number of attributes: 36 attributes (1 case identifier, 1 state identifier, 32 descriptive attributes, 2 dependent variables)

The attributed Ã¢â‚¬Ëœclosed_atÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is used to determine the dependent variable for the time completion prediction task. The attribute Ã¢â‚¬Ëœresolved_atÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is highly correlated with Ã¢â‚¬Ëœclosed_atÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. In this event log, some rows may have the same values (they are equal) since not all attributes involved in the real-world process are present in the log.

Attributes used to record textual information are not placed in this log.

exercises, performed by 30 subjects recorded four sensor modalities.
**Application**
The dataset can be used for exercise recognition, exercise quality assessment and
exercise counting, by developing algorithms for pre-processing, feature extraction,
multi-modal sensor fusion, segmentation and classification.

** Data collection method **
Each subject was given a sheet of 7 exercises with instructions to perform the
exercise at the beginning of the session. At the beginning of each exercise the
researcher demonstrated the exercise to the subject, then the subject performed the
exercise for maximum 60 seconds while being recorded with four sensors. During
the recording, the researcher did not give any advice or kept count or time to enforce
a rhythm.
** Sensors**
Obbrec Astra Depth Camera
- sampling frequency - 15HzÂ 
- frame size - 240x320
Sensing Tex Pressure Mat
- sampling frequency - 15Hz
- frame size - 32*16
Axivity AX3 3-Axis Logging Accelerometer
- sampling frequency - 100Hz
- range - 8g

** Sensor Placement**
All the exercises were performed lying down on the mat while the subject wearing
two accelerometers on the wrist and the thigh. The depth camera was placed above
the subject facing down-words recording an aerial view. Top of the depth camera
frame was aligned with the top of the pressure mat frame and the subjectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s
shoulders such that the face will not be included in the depth camera video.

    -- Data Set Characteristics: Multivariate, Sequential, Time-Series
    -- This dataset represents ambient data collected in homes with volunteer residents.
       Data are collected continuously while residents perform their normal routines.
       Ambient PIR motion sensors, door/temperature sensors, and light switch sensors
       are placed throughout the home of the volunteer.  The sensors are placed in locations
       throughout the home that are related to specific activites of daily living that we
       wish to capture.
    -- The classification task is to predict the activity that is occurring in the smart
       home and being observed by the ambient sensors.  The sensors communicate using the
       ZigBee Pro protocol, forming a mesh network with all battery powered sensors as leaf
       nodes and always-on devices (light switches and ZigBee relays) forming the branches
       that connect back to the USB gateway on our local SHiB [2] server.
    -- The original format captured from the sensors is provided, as well as the feature
       vector we generate using a sliding window of 30 sensor events.  Each annotated data
       file (ex: csh101/csh101.ann.txt) has a corresponding feature vector CSV file
       (ex: csh101/csh101.ann.features.csv).  Most of the sensor data files contain labels
       for two months of the collection period, though some contain labels for extended
       time periods.
    -- We have also included the entire dataset collected at each smart home in the original
       format (ex: csh101/csh101.rawdata.txt) and the generated feature vector CSV file
       (ex: csh101/csh101.rawdata.features.csv).
    -- An analysis of the attributes for each features CSV file is found in the corresponding
       readme (ex: csh101/csh101.ann.features.csv is described by
       csh101/csh101.ann.features.README.txt).
    -- The smart home layout, and sensor placement from the original formats is found
       in the included sensor map for each smart home (ex: csh101/csh101.sensor_map.png).
    -- The original format is:
       <Date> <Time> <Sensor> <Translate01> <Translate02> <Message> <SensorType> <Activity>
        -- <Date> is YYYY-MM-DD, in local time.
        -- <Time> is HH:MM:SS.ms, 24-hour and in local time.
        -- <Sensor> is the name of the sensor, this can be found on the sensor map.
        -- <Translate01> is the room-level sensor location.
        -- <Translate02> is more detailed, usually identifying what in the room the sensor
           is aimed at or sensing.
        -- <Message> is the message generated by the sensor (we define these in more detail
           below).
        -- <SensorType> is the type of sensor generating the event, so you know what to
           expect for a message.  In these earlier smart homes many of the sensors could
           be identified by their name, but in later configurations you had to use this
           field to identify what sensor was sending the message.
        -- Motion Sensor Package
           Each motion sensor package contains a PIR motion detector and a resistive photocell
           light sensor. The package also reports it's battery level and regularly checks
           in with the sensor network (ZigBee Check-Ins).
            -- Control4-Motion and Control4-MotionArea
               Most motion sensors have a sticker in the lens that limits what it can see
               to approximately a 3-foot diameter circle when mounted on the ceiling facing
               down. Some motion sensors that do not have any sticker limiting their view
               are called Control4-MotionArea and can detect motion within view, though
               sensitivity to smaller body movements may be reduced beyond 20 feet.
                -- Message Values
                   Motion and MotionArea sensors always report ON or OFF.
                -- Frequency
                   The sensor will instantly send an ON message when detecting motion.
                   1.25 seconds after it no longer observes motion the sensor will send OFF.
            -- Control4-LightSensor
                -- Message Values
                   The light sensor will send integer values ranging from 0 to 100 (pitch
                   black to very bright). The Motion sensors with stickers in the lens have
                   a much more limited amount of light that hits the sensor, and may only
                   observe a range from 0 to 10, with a rare spike to a much higher value
                   when the lid is removed to replace a battery.
                -- Frequency
                   The current light level is bit-packed and sent with every message the
                   package sends on ZigBee, but the light sensor itself can initiate a ZigBee
                   message if the value changes by 15% from the last value it reported.
            -- Control4-BatteryPercent
                -- Message Values
                   The battery percent is always an integer ranging from 0 to 100.
                -- Frequency
                   The battery levels are only allowed to report once every 6 hours, but
                   only report when there is a change.  This means that some battery values
                   may not be updated for days as the level has not changed.
            -- Control4-Radio
               These sensor messages were enabled when we upgraded our data collection systems
               around 2014.
                -- Message Values
                   The ZigBee radio check-in always has the same message, OK.
                -- Frequency
                   The ZigBee radio checks in with the network about once every 30 minutes.
                   A sudden lack of radio check-ins may indicate this sensor's battery has
                   died or there is some interference disrupting communication on the ZigBee
                   network.
        -- Door Sensor Package
            -- Control4-Door
                -- Message Values
                   The door sensor always report OPEN or CLOSE.
                -- Frequency
                   The sensor sends the message as soon as the magnetic reed switch changes.
            -- Control4-Temperature
               All door sensor packages have an internal temporature sensor, and the ability
               to attach a second temperature probe.  This was used in some of the bathrooms
               for measuring the temperature at the door and right next to the shower.
                -- Message Values
                   Messages are a decimal in Celsius with 0.5 degrees Celsius accuracy.
                -- Frequency
                   Messages are sent when the sensor detects a change in the measured
                   temperature by 0.5 Celsius.
            -- Control4-BatteryPercent
                -- Message Values
                   The battery percent is always an integer ranging from 0 to 100.
                -- Frequency
                   The battery levels are only allowed to report once every 6 hours, but
                   only report when there is a change.  This means that some battery values
                   may not be updated for days as the level has not changed.
            -- Control4-Radio
                -- Message Values
                   The ZigBee radio check-in always has the same message, OK.
                -- Frequency
                   The ZigBee radio checks in with the network about once every 30 minutes.
                   A sudden lack of radio check-ins may indicate this sensor's battery has
                   died or there is some interference disrupting communication on the ZigBee
                   network.
        -- Light Switch Package
            -- Control4-Light
                -- Message Values
                   Light switch messages are integer values ranging from 0 to 100.  Some of
                   the lights are dimmers, they report the change in value from 0 to 100 as
                   they ramp up their brightness.  The switches simply report 0 or 100 when
                   they turn off or on.
                -- Frequency
                   The light switches only report light messages when the value changes.
            -- Control4-Button
               With the data collection upgrade in 2014 we were able to start collecting
               sensor events from residents interacting with the light switches.
                -- Message Values
                   The buttons have a variety of messages they send.  TAP is sent every time
                   the button is pressed.  When the button is doing being tapped, the button
                   will send TAP_COUNT_01 if the button was tapped once (we have observed
                   tap counts as high as 12, but do not know the limit of the device).
                   On the dimmer light switches there are also the DEPRESS and RELEASE messages
                   that are sent then the button is held down to slowly dim the light up
                   or down.
                -- Frequency
                   Messages are only sent with a participant interacts with the button.

                -- Message Values
                   The ZigBee radio check-in always has the same message, OK.
                -- Frequency
                   The ZigBee radio checks in with the network about once every 15 minutes.
                   A sudden lack of radio check-ins may indicate this sensor's battery has
                   died or there is some interference disrupting communication on the ZigBee
                   network.","-- Citation Request:

","For a detailed description of the dataset, please see the following pdf file that is stored with the data:  WISDM-dataset-description.pdf. The raw  accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data is collected from the smartphone and smartwatch at a rate of 20Hz. It is collected from 51 test subjects as they perform 18 activities for 3 minutes apiece. The sensor data for each device (phone, watch) and type of sensor (accelerometer, gyroscope) is stored in a different directory (so there are 4 data directories). In each directory there are 51 files corresponding to the 51 test subjects. The format of every entry is the same: <subject-id, activity-code, timestamp, x, y, z>. The descriptions of these attributes are provided with the attribute information. In addition to the raw time-series sensor data we also generate examples that describe the sensor data using a 10-second window. See the dataset description document for details. Although this data can most naturally be used for activity recognition, it can also be used to build behavioral biometric models since each sensor reading is associated with a specific subject.","Please cite the IEEE Access article: Smartphone and Smartwatch-Based Biometrics Using Activities of Daily Living.
